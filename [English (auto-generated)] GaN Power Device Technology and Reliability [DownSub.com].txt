hello everyone uh welcome to idm

tutorial game power device technology

and reliability uh my name is tong

sobley from texas instrument

and before starting this tutorial i

would like to first thank ibm committee

for giving me this opportunity

so today i have three goals

first i would like to provide a general

overview of galvanized trade power

devices for people who are not familiar

with this technology

and then we'll review the keto live

topics in this device

it's a relatively new technology

understanding potential reliability

issues and developing innovative

solutions are very critical for

successful technology qualification and

commercialization

and finally we'll review the recent

progress of this technology which can

give us some idea how the future gained

electronics will look like

so this is the outline of my talk so

after a brief introduction on the

gallium nitride and its benefits we'll

first cover the basics of the gantt

devices including the gen fb device

structure and device operation

and then based on that background i will

see that what kinds of potential

reliability can happen in this device so

we'll start with the intrinsic device

level and move to the application level

reliability

and lastly i will review the recent

innovations which can push the again

electronics to the next level

so let's start so why should we use a

gallium nitride we can first check the

benefits of the gallium nitride and the

point of material properties

so if you see the right table

is a wide bandwidth semiconductor with a

high critical electric field is about 10

times higher than silicon and also

electromobility is also quite high

and this combination high critical

electric field and high electromobility

makes this material very promising for

high power for high frequency devices

and in addition to the excellent

electrical properties the thermal

conductivity of the gallium nitride is

as good as the silicon which is also

very important for devices handling high

power

and manufacturability and costs are

always the main concern for new devices

and new materials

but thanks to the success of the led

industry these concerns are much less in

gallium nitride and the cost gap between

the gallium nitride and silicon is

continuously decreasing thanks to wafer

scaling

and how these benefits can be reflected

to the actual device performance

to help your understanding i put simple

circuit model for power device so in

addition to the device dc resistance

there are a couple of important ac

parameters for power devices for example

the input capacitance cg of capacitance

coss and also reverse recovery charge

qrr

and first thanks to high critical

electric field can device can support

the higher voltage with a smaller device

dimension and with a combination of a

high electron mobility the smaller

device dimension reduces the on

resistance which is a helpful for

conduction loss reduction

and also the input and our capacitances

are scaled with over device size and

also with our rsp

this is because we can reduce the total

device width to meet the same rds on

so low input and capacitances reduce the

switching loss and also make it possible

to operate this device at higher

frequency

and also different from conventional

silicon power devices there is no body

diode in gallium nitride so there is no

reverse recovery loss associated with

the body diode and it reduces the

ringing in the switching node and also

opens up a possibility for new circuit

policies

so thanks to all these benefits gallium

nitride technology can take multiple

power to previously on achievable

frequency range and power density so if

you see this feature

it shows the potential gain market in

power and frequency domain

and is intersecting the emerging

multi-billion dollar market for

electrification of the non-traditional

applications such as the grid

infrastructure and the automotive

and this

is a one example to show the benefit in

the of the gallium nitride technology in

power supply design so it's an

end-to-end power conversion from the ac

power line to the point of load

so in the first stage the temple pfc can

provide more than 99

efficiency with about three times higher

power density than conventional silicon

solutions

and also the following lsc and the

single-stage converter also outperformed

the silicon solutions by far in terms of

frequency and power density

so as you can see in this example the

gan technology can push the performance

of the power system significantly which

drives fast and widespread market

adoption so this is from the this year's

geology report so the gan market in 2020

i was expanded by about two times

compared to the 2019

and the main market penetration i just

started in consumer electronics such as

laptop or smartphone chargers and also

the adoption in other areas such as data

center telecom and ultimately automotive

is expected to grow continuously as you

can see in the projection

so there is very high level overview of

gallium nature technology and now we're

going to zoom in and try to understand

the basics of the organ device

so we can start with the crystal

structure so the gallium nitride crystal

structure is uh

ultras and as you can see in this left

figure the gallium and nitrogen atoms

are arranged in a closely spaced

hexagonal by layers if the gallium is on

top of the bilayer it is called as a

gallium phase if nitrogen is at the top

is called as a nitrogen phase

and typically the gallium phase is

mainly used for power devices because

it's much easier to grow and process

and one of the unique characteristics in

gallium nitride is a polarization

so gallium and nitrogen atoms form ionic

bonding and the shared electrons in the

bonding are asymmetrically distributed

because of the large difference in the

electronegativity between the gallium

and nitrogen as you can see in the

polling scale table

and since this ultra crystal structure

does not have an inversion symmetry the

asymmetric charge distribution in each

bonding does not cancel out and forms a

net flygation field

in the gallium phase the polygon field

direction is downward

and the nitrogen phase is upward

direction

and this polarization field plays a very

important role in gan device and we're

going to uh in the after few slides

so if you see the actual epi structure

used for high voltage power devices it

has a multiple layers

so if you start with from the bottom

first we need a substrate so if you have

a pure gallium nitride substrate it's

much easier to grow

high quality thick gallium nitride but

unfortunately there are still many

technical challenges to grow the high

quality and large scale gallium nitrite

substrate with low cost

so people typically use the holding

substrate such as a silicon sapphire or

silicon carbide and silicone is the most

popular choice especially for power

devices because of its low cost and the

scalability

but we cannot grow the high quality

gallium nitride directly on top of the

silicon substrate because there is a

vertically large lattice constant

mismatch so if you see this center

figure

there is about 15

lattice constant mismatches between the

silicon and the gallium nitride and also

there is relatively large difference in

the summary expansion coefficient

so to grow the gallium nitride on top of

the silicon substrate we first need to

put the aluminium nitrite nucleation

layer as a foundation and also need we

need to put relatively thick buffer

so there are two main roles of these

buffer layers uh first

it reduces the impact of the mismatch of

the lattice constant and the sum are

mismatched

and also it blocks the high voltage in

the vertical direction

so in terms of the buffer layer design

there are two main types the first one

is a step grade the argon buffer

so on top of the aluminum nitride we

start with a higher aluminum percent

elegant layer

and gradually reduce the aluminium

percent through multiple steps so that

we can reach the gallium nitride

another option is a super lattice which

alternates the aluminum nitride and

gallium nitride for aluminum nitride and

aluminium gallium nitride

so once the buffer growth is done the

next step is the back barrier

the purpose of the back barrier is to

suppress the vertical or lateral liquid

current

so if you grow the gallium nitride

without any doping

the gallium nitride tends to become weak

n-type

this is because the silicon or oxygen

which are present in the epi chamber are

good n-type dopants for gallium nitride

so if you grow just the undoped gallium

nitride the fermi level is closer to the

close to the firm conduction band so

under high

voltage stress the electron electrons in

the channel can spill over to the buffer

and cause a large letter or vertical

liquid current

so to compensate the anti-dopant effect

the carbon is mainly used as a deep

acceptor

so if you dope the back better with the

carbon now the fermi level is pinned at

the carbon level which is about 0.7 eb

from the balance band

so as you can see in this figure the

entire band is raised which can provide

a better charge confinement so it can

reduce the vertical and lateral liquid

current

because of the similar reason we also

use the carbon as a for the buffer

doping

it reduce the background carrier density

by compensating the antibiotics in the

back in the buffer layers so if you see

the this center figure with increasing

the carbon level in the buffer we can

effectively suppress the vertical

leakage current across the buffer layers

but in spite of this benefit we cannot

keep increasing the carbon level in the

back barrier or the buffer layer because

first if if you increase the carbon

level too much it reduces it degrades

the crystal quality of the gallium

nitride and also if the highly carbon

layer is too close to the channel it can

cause a severe electron trapping

moreover

if the carbon level goes above a certain

threshold it can cause it can also flip

the leakage versus the carbon trend so

if you see this is the right feeder

up to about 19 per cubic centimeter the

increasing carbon is helpful for the

breakdown voltage improvement

but within if the carbon level goes

above the above 919 where i close to the

120 now the trend is flipped and we

start to see the degradation of the

liquid current

so the carbon level optimization is one

of the key design parameters for high

quality of the design

so once the back better growth is done

now the next step is the typefactory

structure

for gallium nitride channel we typically

don't do any doping to maximize electron

mobility and also minimize the number of

traps and the gallium nitride channel is

capped with the argon barrier

so the lattice constant of the argon

barrier is smaller than the gallium

nitride

so if you grow the aluminum gallium

nitride on top of gallium nitride

pseudomotically the top eigenvalue gets

a tensile stress

and here the polarization field that we

discussed in the crystal structure part

plays a very important role

so first

both gallium and aluminum gallium

nitride have a spontaneous polarization

field coming from the woodside crystal

structure

and on top of that aluminium gallium

nitride has a piezoelectricalization

caused by the strain

so if you draw the nebulization charges

across the header structure you can find

that there is very strong electric field

in diagram barrier

and because of this high electric field

the surface donor states can be

activated and electrons coming out of

the donor states can fall down to the

gallium nitride following the electric

field and these electrons can be

accumulated at eigengan interface

so these accumulated electrons are

called as a two dimensional electron gas

shortly to that and it is used as a main

channel in gan device

since the origin of the two deck channel

is the pollution field in the argon

barrier

its electron density is also determined

by the argon barrier design

for example by increasing the aluminium

percent in the argon barrier or by

thickening the eigen thickness we can

increase the two deck density so typical

trade density level is about 13 per

square centimeter which is pretty high

in addition to the high electron density

the electron mobility is also quite high

in the gallium nitride if you see this

the right figure the gallium natural

birth mobility is mainly limited by the

impurity scattering

but in the case of the two deck channel

thanks to the separation between the

donor states and the two deck channel

the impurity scattering is much less so

the electron mobility can be as high as

over 2000 at room temperature

so once the epi growth is done now we

can fabricate the device only and this

left figure shows a typical again device

structure

so first thing you can notice is that

it's a leather device so current flows

electrically through this two deck

channel

and again in the gain channel there is

no pn junction so typically for again

device fabrication people do not use the

implantation for additional doping

there are a couple of reasons for that

first the high electromobility channel

is formed automatically during the

epigraphs so there is no need to form

additional doped layer for electron

supply

and also even though you want to do

additional doping with the implantation

is quite challenging to activate the

dopants and the cure the

implantation damage it requires about 12

to 13 degrees c on yielding temperature

which can affect overall peak quality

and also other process conditions

since there is no pn junction in the

gantt in game device which is used to

block high voltage in combustion or

silicon power devices the gan device

relies on multiple field flights for

high electric field engineering

so in this device you can find the three

uh field plates so one gate connected

field plate and two source connected

field plates

and we're going to talk about these

field plates a little more when we

discuss the device operation

lastly the gan device is a naturally

depletion mode device

since the two deck channel is formed

automatically during the epic growth

the channel is formed under the gate

without any gate bias but in other words

to shut off the device we need to apply

negative capabilities which is actually

not desirable for power devices because

it raises concern for safety and device

controllability

so to make a normally off or enhancement

mode device we need additional

engineering in gate area

so there has been extensive research to

make a stable enhancement mode again

devices so here we can review the three

different approaches

the first one is the argon barrier

recess

the origin of the two deck channel is

the collision field in the argon barrier

so by removing the argon barrier

partially or completely under the gate

we can kill the two deck under the gate

and make the investment mode device

so this approach is most straightforward

but there are a couple of process

challenges

first

threshold voltage can be dependent on

the remaining ibm barrier but this

control is not easy it's a time get

and also during this edge process

the mobility under the gate can be

degraded due to the plasma damage

second approach is to introduce the

negative eye

charges under the gate

for as an example uh you can expose the

gate area to the flowing plasma and

fluorine ions can be implanted in the

argon barrier and the negative charges

of the fluorine ions can deplete the

truth channel under the gate

so this approach is interesting but

there also there is some concerns

so first

the threshold voltage can be dependent

on the amount of the flowing ions

implanted and activated in diagon

barrier which is relatively thin

and also there is some concern about the

stability of the implanted fluid ions

during the high temperature process or

long-term operation

the last approach is the p-gan on top of

the galagan barrier

so if you grow the peak and on top of

the eigenvalue now the entire gate

structure is like a pn junction

so the for the built-in potential

difference between the p-gan and the

n-type channel can raise the band and it

depletes the true deck channel under the

gate

so since the pgan is a pig and growth is

done during the epi growth

this approach can have a better

threshold voltage controllability

compared to the other approaches

and until now the digital protein is

winning so most of the commercial

investment model devices use this p gain

gate structure

so here we can review the main device

configurations in current game market

so both e-mode and demos are present

and these first two device

configurations use the depletion mode

again device but users don't need to

take care of the negativity issue

so in the first device configuration

depletion mode gain device is connected

to the silicon flap

in series like a cascode an entire chip

is controlled by the silicon device

whose vt is positive

second in the second configuration the

silicon gate driver is co-packaged with

a depletion mode gain device and this

integrated gate driver generates a

negative voltage and drives a depletion

mode game device the third one is

a standalone enhancement mode device and

the first one is very similar to the

second one but again device is in

estimate mode

in the first or the third configurations

the separate gate drivers are needed

while in the second and first options

the gate drivers are already integrated

so now we can check the device operation

so there are three main operation modes

so in the first one is the forward

conduction mode which is basically on

state so in the honest state the device

own resistance is most important which

determines the conduction loss

second operation mode is a reverse

conduction mode which is also called as

a third quadrant

so in this state the gate source voltage

is below threshold voltage but the drain

voltage goes to the negative value so

the channel can be turned on because

gate drain voltage is our threshold

voltage

since device is in saturation mode in

the reverse conduction mode the source

drain voltage to flow the required

switching current determines the

conduction loss

in the off state high voltage blocking

high voltage blocking is the most

important obviously

so now we can check the inside of the

again device in each operation mode

so to help your understanding is

compared with the conventional

particular silicon power devices

first in the forward conduction mode

there is nothing

special

so in the silicon device the current

flows vertically through the end drip

and the inverted channel in gan device

current flows laterally through to this

two deck channel

but there is a clear difference in the

third quadrant or reverse conduction

mode between these two devices

in the silicone power device the first

time the reverse conduction mode channel

is off

and as drainable scores the negative

value the body diode between the p body

and then drift a tonsil so current flows

through this body diode

so the current path between the forward

conduction mode and the reverse

conduction mode is different

on in-game device there is no body diode

so now the drain voltage has to go to

more negative values to turn on the

channel so once the gate drain voltage

becomes above the threshold voltage now

the channel is on so the current flows

it is to that channel again but now the

conduction reaction is opposite

since the threshold voltage of the

gallium nitride device is generally

higher than the body tone and voltage

the conduction loss in the reverse

conduction mode can be higher in the

gain device

so in gain circuit design it's important

to minimize this reverse conduction mode

time to minimize the efficiency

degradation

the way to block the high voltage in the

off state is also different between

these two devices

in the silicon power device the p body

and end drift is reverse biased and this

reverse p and bias pn junction is the

way to block high voltage

but in game device the high voltage

blocking is done by this multiple field

plates

so field plates are basically the

multiple gates with the different

negative threshold voltages

and these field plates are connected to

the gate or source which are zero

voltage in the off state

so if you see this right figure

in the off state first gate is off so

channel the electrons under the gate are

depleted

and as the drain voltage increases the

potential difference between the first

field plate and channel reaches the

threshold voltage of the first field

plate so the electrons under the first

field plate are depleted so is it like a

shutting off the gate

so once this happens now the hydrogen

voltage cannot go into the inner device

region and is blocked by this field play

until the next field played effect kicks

in

the next field plate has can block the

higher voltage because it has a more

negative threshold voltage because of

the thicker dialect film

so by putting multiple field plates in

series we can increase the maximum

blocking voltage

and here there is an important

difference in electric electric field

distribution between these two devices

in silicon device the high electric

field is mainly handled inside of the

silicon

but in gan device main electric field

lines come out of the gallium nitride

and go through the dialect films

so because of that the dialect film

reliability is very important in gan

devices and we're going to see it in the

following reliability section

so until now we reviewed the basics of

the again devices and now we're going to

see what kinds of potential reliability

issues can happen in this device

so we'll first see the intrinsic device

level covering three important topics uh

tddb time dependent dialect breakdown

the threshold voltage instability and

the dynamic rds zone

so reliability is always the main

concern for new devices

but every device has a failure mode

so this electric figure describes the

main reliability issues in conventional

silicon devices

the first one is threshold voltage

instability which is also called as a

bti

the second one is a heart care effect so

hot carriers can be generated under high

drainabilities and can damage the divide

through the impact ionization

and also the trapping or dialect

breakdown of gate oxide are also

important relief issues in silicon

mosfets

and the gan device is nothing different

from silicon mosfet we are seeing pretty

much similar failure modes in this

device

in the gate area the threshold voltage

instability or the gate breakdown can

happen

and also in the dialect film where the

gallium nitride that be the strong the

high electric field from the drain can

cause electron trapping or breakdown

issues

so what we need to do is to understand

these potential degradation modes and

engineer the device and process properly

to meet the required reliability

lifetime

so let's first check the time dependent

dialect breakdown shortly tdd

so tdb occurs in polar materials under

high electric field

and the dialect films used in the

semiconductor process such as a silicon

oxide or silicon nitride are polar

materials

and as you reviewed in the crystals

structural part the gallium nitride also

has a polar material property

so once these materials are exposed to

the high electric field the lattice gets

strained

and the defects can be formed

and once the defects form the

percolation path along the field

direction

now the catastrophic dialect breakdown

can happen with the large leakage

current

and the damage caused by the time

dependent dialect breakdown is not

recoverable

so in game device there are a couple of

reasons that we need to check the tdp

issue

first in the on state especially the in

enhancement mode device under positive

gate voltage the gate that is exposed to

the vertical electric field

so we need to check the onstate ktdb

in the off state more regions are

exposed to a strong electric field

because of the high drainabilities for

example the dialect film near the field

plate and also the gallium nitride fe

so let's first tap on stage htdp in the

emo device

but for that we need to understand this

gate structure

so if you see this left figure the

p-type gallium nitride doped with the

magnesium is grown on top of the argon

barrier and the gate metal is directly

set as on the

p-type gallium nitride

and depending on the contact property of

this gate metal the way that this gate

structure operates can be changed

if the gain metal forms are only context

to the pgand now this gauge structure

can be simplified as a series connection

of the resistor and heterojunction pn

diode

so under positive gate voltage there is

a negligible voltage drop in this

register part which is basically the

p-gan gate junction and most of the

voltage is applied to this parameter

junction which is argon barrier

so in the ome contact-based gate

structure the onstage tdb is mainly

determined by the argon barrier

reliability

on the other hand if the game metal

forms are shocking contact to the pgan

now this gate structure becomes like a

back-to-back connected diodes

so under positive gate voltage this

top junction becomes a reverse biased

shock junction while the bottom junction

is forward biased

since the voltage drop occurs in both of

the reasons the maximum voltage that we

can apply is higher in this shocky

contact-based gate structure

and also thanks to this reverse biased

shock junction the gear leakage current

is much lower in this shaky contact case

structure

so if you see the energy band diagram

first under the zero gate bias there is

no electron at the eigengan interface

and the formula level is aligned to the

magnesium level in the p-gap

so magnesium level is about 0.2 eb from

the balance band and this is about

roughly about 10 times higher than the

thermal energy at room temperature

so about one percent of the magnesium

dopants can be activated in this

quadratic neutral pigeon region

so typical peak and doping level is

about 1 in 19 per cubic centimeter so

effective whole density is about one is

17 ish

so once you apply the positive gate

voltage now of course the gain metal and

p gain junction is a reverse bias

so holes in the topic and junctions are

depleted

and in this depletion reason different

from the quadratic neutral region now

almost 100 percent maximum dopants can

be activated because of the this energy

band bending

so the surface electric field can be

quite high

and holes coming from the depletion

region are now accumulated at argan

pigeon interface and these positive

charges attract the electrons in the on

the other side and are gonna interface

so this is how the two deck channel is

formed under the positive voltage

so as you can see in this band structure

the voltage drop occurs in top peak and

junction as well as argon barrier so

when we study the

onstage http in the shocky content-based

emo device both of the reasons

need to be considered

so there has been extensive research to

improve the on-state gate tdb

in emo device especially the shocking

contact-based emo device and most of the

research here focused on the top shock

junction because that's where high

electric field exists and also the

electron current or the leakage current

is limited

so if you here we can review the three

different approaches

so first

the undocked gallium nitride is grown on

top of the peak and layer

and thanks to the lower doping level now

the surface electric field is reduced so

the

maximum gate voltage margin is improved

by more than three volts as you can see

in this bottom figure

in the second approach now the n-type

gallium nitride is grown on top of pecan

so in this structure now top sharky

junction is changed to the pn junction

generally the pn junction can provide

more uniform and lower electric field

than the shaky junction

so the ktdp lifetime is improved

significantly with of a few older

driving making to the galaxy current

reduction

in the last approach the gallium oxide

nitride is formed by oxidizing the peak

and surface

the gallium oxide nitride has a slightly

larger energy band gap and also the

better material stability so it can

provide the better a longer tdb lifetime

as well as

lower gear leds as you can see in this

feature

so now we can move to the off state td

ratio so in the off state

one of the key reasons that we need to

think about is the dialect films near

the field plates

so if you see this figure in the off

state the electrons in the channel are

depleted which expose the particle

pollution charges

so the electric field is formed between

these positive charges and the field

plate

and especially the electric field is

very high near the field plate that's

because of the field concentration

the tk simulation shown in this bottom

figure also confirms the high electric

field in the field gate field blade edge

and this right figure shows the actual

failure analysis of the device which

failed during the high voltage offset

stress

so this is a gate and you can also see

the med1 and metal field plane and if

you zoom in this gate area you can

clearly see that the failure started

from the gauge field blade edge and the

main field failure direction is also

aligned to the field direction

so to prevent this dialect film

breakdown near the field plate we need

to optimize the field plate and the fb

so in terms of the field plate design uh

the

transition from the one field plate to

the next field plate uh has to gradual

enough to suppress any exterior electric

field crowding

and also we need to use the high quality

dialect film to maximize the dialect

film lifetime under high electric field

and in terms of the ip design tool deck

density is quite critical

so high to that density is good for

device own resistance but bad for tddb

so when we design the heterostructure

these two computing factors has to be

balanced

another reason that we need to check the

tddb in the off state is the gallium

nitride b

in typical gantt device configuration

the substrate is grounded so there is a

vertical electric field between the top

side drain channel

and the substrate

so for example if the 600 volt is

applied to the drain and the gallium

nitride of the thickness is a 2 micron

the average electric field across the

gannet is about 3 megavolts per

centimeter

so this value is still lower than the

critical electric field of the gallium

nitride which is about 3.4 ml per

centimeter

so you may not see that instant device

breakdown

but if you leave the device under this

stress for enough time device will

eventually fail before meeting the

required reliable time

and this is because

the gallium nitride also has the tdw

issue

so in other words we cannot design the

gallium nitride epi thickness just based

on the critical electric field

so to find the tar the appropriate epi

thickness for target operation voltage

we need the actual ftd modeling and

people typically use voltage or

temperature acceleration

and this tdd gain gallium nitride ftd

mechanism is one of the key factors to

determine the maximum voltage capability

of the gan device

so in this aspect

we can think about the theoretical limit

of the gallium nitride

so polygon figure merit is widely used

to evaluate the potential of

semiconductor materials especially for

power devices

and it's mainly determined by the

mobility and the critical electric field

but in the case of the gallium nitride

this theoretical limit only reflects the

time zero performance because gallium

nitride has a tddb issue

so in other words the maximum electric

field to meet the required level

lifetime can be lower than the critical

electric field

so it is very challenging to push the

gantt device to the theoretical limit

and this need to be considered in the

actual device design

so now let me move to the second

reliability issue which is a threshold

voltage instability

so let me start with the real basic so

this left figure shows a transfer curve

so the black curve is from the fresh

device so with all state capabilities

the own current is high

and with offstage capabilities leakage

current is low

so now let's see what happens there if

there is a negative weight shift which

is the red curve

we don't have any problem in the own

state but in the off state now the

leakage current is increased

significantly

so what's the problem in actual circuit

so if you see the typical half reaches

circuit and if you assume the high side

phase is on and low side fade is off and

if there is a negative relationship

issue in the low side fat

now the low side back cannot block the

high voltage so there can be a large

liquid current which can increase the

conduction loss and if it becomes

serious it can also cause a shoot

through issue and also it can cause a

short circuit event which can damage the

entire system

then how about the positivity shift so

if you see the blue curve now we don't

have any problem in the off state but

now in the on state the own current is

reduced because of the reduction of the

gate over drive

so in the same circuit now we have a

problem in the high side fat because the

increase the increase of in the device

resistance can increase the conduction

loss

so in the depletion mode device with the

gate dielectric the negativity to shift

is the main concern

so if you see this left figure the fresh

device shows about minus two volts vt

but after a negative gate voltage stress

vt becomes more negative

so the longer stay longer stress time

makes the vt uh

the amount of the weight shift larger

and also it is accelerated by the higher

temperature

and also high drain voltage kind of

affect this negative shift so if you see

this right figure after high voltage

high drain voltage stress the transfer

curve is shifted from the red curve to

the blue curve

so the multiple factors can trigger this

negatively to shift the gate or

drainable stress longer stress time and

higher temperature

so there has been extensive research to

understand this

mechanism of this negative shift

so one possible explanation is the donor

states at eigen dialect interface

can be activated under gate or drain

voltage stress

and

this effect can provide a positive

charge effect in this location which

attracts the more electrons at

gun interface so this can cause a

negativity to shift

another explanation is also related to

donor states but the location is not

argon dialect interface but in the

gallium natural channel or in back

barrier reason

but similar to the

surface donor states once these donor

states in the gantt channel are

activated it provides the fixed positive

charge effect which causes a negative

weight to shift

lastly the holes generated under high

drain voltage stress can flow into the

external area following the electric

field and get injected into the gate

area and cause a negatively shift

and this negativity shift

is one of the key reasons why it's very

challenging to make a stable inesman

model operation with a gate dielectric

so in this study the trigate again

devices were fabricated with two

different gauge structures

so in the first device the aluminium

oxide oxide aluminum oxide was used as a

gate oxide so the gas structure is like

a typical mis structure

so in this device especially at room

temperature the vt is quite positive

thanks to this trigger structure

so although there is some hysteresis vp

is close to zero so you can call it as

effectively as the initial mode device

but if you go to the higher temperature

and do the forward and reverse bias

sweep you can clearly see that there is

a large negativity to shift

so even though at time zero it can be

recorded as a investment mode device but

after the stress

it becomes a depletion mode device

but now in the second device this

aluminum oxide was replaced by the

p-type nucleoxide

since this is a p-type oxide now the

gate structure is like a p-n junction

and in this device the negative way to

shift is significantly suppressed

and this data may explain why we are

seeing more stable enhancement mode

operation with a pgan-based

gate structure and compared to the other

enhancement mode approaches with the

gate dielectric

now we can move to the

threshold voltage instability in the

e-mode device

so e-mode device gauge structure is a

little more complex than the d mode so

especially though when the gain metal

forms a sharpie contacts with the keygen

the gate structure is like a backpack

connected to the diodes

and this can be modeled as a series and

parallel connection of a

voltage-dependent resistor and

capacitors

so in the case of the top junction is a

reverse biased shock junction so the

resistance is determined by the reverse

bias liquid current in this stop sharky

junction and the capacitance is the top

peak and depletion capacitance

in the case of the bottom junction the

resistance is mainly determined by the

forward bias current

and the capacitance is a series

combination of the eigenvalue

capacitance and the gallium nitride

depletion capacitance

and most importantly this center node

which is a pgam is a kind of floating

and this can cause various dynamic

effects

for example if you do the transfer curve

sweep with a very short pulse the

initial pigeon potential can be affected

by the pre-sweep condition

so if you see this bottom left figure

before the sweep the positive gate pulse

stress was applied

and the accessible holes accumulated in

the peak and during this positive gate

voltage stress affect the peak and

potential and cause the only device

tunnel

so if you see the center figure compared

to the transfer curve measured with the

dc setup

the parse transfer curve after the

positive gate voltage stress shows more

negativity

but if you use a longer purse or wait

for enough time the excessive holes in

the pgam can be consumed and the gap

between the first measurement and the dc

measurement is reduced

so because of this dynamic effect

the amount of the vt shift can be also

dependent on the measurement setup in

this p-gang gate structure

in addition to the pure dynamic effect

there is also trap-induced vt shift

so this left figure monitors the

threshold voltage as a function of

stress time under different gate voltage

conditions

when gate voltage is a relative low we

typically observe the positive vt shift

which is due to the electron trapping at

eigengan interface

but if you increase the gate voltage

further we start to see the negativity

shift due to the whole trapping where

the neutralization of magnesium dopants

in the case of the magazine dopants if

you grow the p-gan on top of the argon

barrier the magnesium can diffuse into

the argon barrier so if you do the sims

measurement after the growth you can see

the magnesium tail in the argon barrier

so magnesium in the argan barrier are

activated because of the pollution

field in the argan barrier and it can

cause the more positive vt in the fresh

device

but under positive gauge voltage stress

the pollution field in diagon battery is

reduced and a lot of holes can get in

can be injected into the argon barrier

and this effect

reduced the number of ionized magnesium

concentration in the argon barrier as

you can see in this figure and this can

cause negativity to shift

everything stability in the pig and gate

also is also observed after off-stage

stress

so this research investigates the video

shift after high voltage off state

so if you see this a left figure first

the devices were stressed in the high

voltage off state and they came back to

the global piece and transport curves

were measured

and after high voltage off state the

positivity shift is observed as you can

see in this figure

an amount of the shift increases with

increasing the offset drain voltage

but what is very interesting is one of

the leadership shows a direct

correlation to the charged image to the

peak and gate in the during the off

state

so what happens is

during the off state this p-game and the

channel junction is a reverse bias

so holes in the pgan region

are depleted and they can escape the

peak and through this top sharky

junction

but once the device comes back to the

low voltage state now the holes

have to come back to the pgand but it

takes time because now they have to go

through this reverse bias sharky

junction

and this delay caused the whole

deficiency in the p gap and caused the

positivity to shift

so as you can see in these uh studies

the pigan gate can have a various

dynamic

leadership behaviors and these effects

need to be considered in the device

design and also circuit design

last but not least the dynamic rds zone

is also very important phenomenon in gan

device

i believe that this dynamic rdso has

been studied most extensively among all

other reliable issues in gallium nitride

so simply speaking the dynamic radiation

so called the chrome collapse

is already so increased during switching

operation

so device switches between on and off

state and after coming back from the off

state the onstate resistance is degraded

compared to the fresh device

but this degradation is not permanent if

you stop switching and wait for enough

time the most of our adjacent

degradation can be recovered

the recurrent time varies from some

microsecond to a few tens of hours so to

capture the older dynamic artists in

effect it is important to minimize the

delay between the stress and measurement

so this right figure shows the dynamic

radius zone of good and bad devices

under high voltage switching and the rds

zone was measured with less than one

microsecond delay

so in the good device the rds on drift

is negligible while in the bad device

rds zone shoots drops so its rds is

increased by few times this can cause a

severe conduction loss increase and also

cause the additional cell feeding

so the cause of the dynamic rds zone is

the electron trapping under high

electric field stress

and then in the following slides we're

going to review the couple of different

electron trapping mechanisms in gen

device and what kinds of process

improvement is needed to suppress them

the first electron trapping mechanism is

leakage current induced surface trapping

so in gan device high voltage blocking

is done by these multiple field plates

and this means that these field plates

are exposed to the high electric field

so electrons in the field plate can be

ejected due to this high electric field

and they can be trapped in the

dielectric or dielectric elegant

interface

especially the argon surfaces are many

donor states where the electrons can be

trapped

and the gallium nitride does not have a

high quality native oxide which can

pacify these surface states like a

silicon oxide for silicon

so once the

many electrons are trapped in these

surface states

these electrons can

deplete the true deck channel and

increase the device resistance

and also in the off state these trapped

electrons can increase the depletion

reason and expand the

push out the depletion reason

and since this is a similar to the

similar to similar that there is

additional gate in this access region so

it's also called as a watergate effect

so if this virtual gate effect is a

severe you can also change the electric

field profile completely

so if you see this right figure with the

negotiable electron trapping the

electric field peak

is formed near the gate field plate edge

and most of the voltage drop also occurs

in this region

but once the severe vulture get effect

happens now the depletion region is

expanding and the electric field peak is

now formed near the drain edge

so to suppress this surface trapping

mechanism we obviously need a high

quality surface participation technology

so there has been uh various studies on

the

fibrostatic films such as

silicon nitride silicon oxide aluminium

oxide aluminum nitride etc

but in current industries uh the silicon

nitride or silicon oxide are mainly used

to suppress this surface electric

trapping mechanism

another way to suppress this surface

trapping is to reduce the electron

supply

so as you reviewed in the previous slide

the main source of the electron is the

liquid current caused by high electric

field

so by reducing the electric field near

the field plate pets we can effectively

suppress this process

for example instead of using a single

field plate by using the multiple field

plate we can effectively reduce the

electric field peak

so if you see this right figure

compared to the single field plate

device the dual field plate devices show

much lower peak electric field and is

also helpful for the dynamic rds and

performance improvement

but this uh the

field plate uh techno field plate option

is not free because with the increasing

the number of field plates the process

complexity increases and also it can

also affect the

switching performance because it

increases the output capacitance

so when we design the field plate

multiple factors need to be considered

dialect from tddb the dynamic rds zone

process complexity and also the output

capacitance

another important electron trapping

mechanism in in the off state is the

electron trapping inside of the gallium

nitride fee

so as you reviewed in the ttp part there

is a vertical electric field between the

drain side channel and the substrate

so electrons in the substrate can be

injected into the gallium nitride and

they can be trapped

so to study this electron trapping

mechanism

the people typically use the backing

stress configuration

so to replicate the drain side result in

the standard device in the off state

then now you apply the negative

substrate voltage with applying low

voltage on top terminals

so in this case the entire device is

exposed to the vertical electric field

so the electron traffic in gallium

nitride epi can be amplified

but at the same time since we apply the

low voltage on top terminals we can

exclude the surface trapping mechanism

that we reviewed in the previous slide

so if you see the bottom figures

the dynamic rds zone of the standard

device shows a very similar temperature

dependence to the back getting stress

data

this indicates that the dominant

trapping mechanism in this device is the

electron trapping in gallium nitrate

and to suppress this electron trapping

in the epi

the growth happy growth condition

optimization is critical

for example the

carbon level

is optimization is very critical for

high quality design and even in the same

carbon level the other growth conditions

such as the temperature or pressure can

affect the crystal quality

and also similar to the surface trapping

mechanism we can also reduce the

electron supply to the again fb

so by improving the aluminum nitrate

nucleation layer and also purple layer

we can reduce we can suppress the

electron injection into the gallium

nitride fee

as one example this right figure shows

that there is a good correlation between

the particular diffusion current in the

off state and the dynamic rdso

so basically by making the buffer more

insulating we can improve the dynamic

reduction performance by suppressing

this buffer trapping mechanism

how care injection is another important

trapping mechanism in gallium nitride

so if there are 10 electrons on the high

electroelectric field these electrons

get accelerated under high electro

electric field and these energy

electrons can be trapped in the surface

states or gallium nitride

so to study this heart care injection

effect the high voltage stem ions

state stress setup can be used so if you

see this center figure the rds zone was

monitored as a function of stress time

under high voltage semi on state stress

so with the increasing the channel

current from the 100 mm to the 10

microamp the rds of degradation is

accelerated because uh higher channel

current means that a higher number of

channel hot electrons

and this high electron effect has a

negative temperature activation because

the increase in the lattice scattering

at high temperature can suppress the hot

electron generation

so if the dominant electron trapping

mechanism is a heart care injection the

dynamic rds and performance can be

actually improved at higher temperature

as you can see in this figure

but this high voltage stem ion state

stress setup is useful to study the hot

chair injection effect but since this is

a dc setup there is a several there are

several limitations

for example we cannot use a high voltage

and high current at the same time

because it can cause a severe cell

feeding

so as another option we can use a double

purse measurement

so by controlling the gate and the drain

voltage signals separately we can create

the overlap time

so during this overlap time device turns

on under high drain voltage so during

this overlap time a lot of hot carriers

can be generated but we don't need to

worry about the severe cell feeding

because this overlap time is very short

so this study showed in that the center

figure

studied the impact of this overlap time

on device behavior

and if you see this center figure with

increasing this overlap time the el

signal coming out of the device

increases

because of because the with a longer

overlap time

the number of hot carriers increases

at the same time the dynamic rds and

performance is degraded because of the

heart carrier injection mechanism

but in some other cases you may see

completely opposite case

so if you see this right figure

now with the increasing this overlap

time the dynamic rds where chrome flap's

performance is actually improved

which is a completely opposite result to

the research the data shown in the

center figure

this is because the hot electrons also

can cause the impact ionization

and holes generated in the impact

ionization

can compensate attract electrons and

improve the dynamic artisan performance

so about a couple of years ago the

hybrid drain technology which uses this

whole compensation effect was uh

published

so

additional p-type gallium nitride

contact was added in front of the ohmic

drain contact

and the holes get injected from this

additional contact and these holes

compensate the trapped electrons and

improve the dynamic adjacent performance

so if you see this right figure compared

to the reference device structure this

hybridization device structure shows

much better artisan stability at higher

drainabilities

so we have reviewed a couple of

different electron trapping mechanisms

in gen device

so although we reviewed each trapping

mechanism they separate

mechanisms separately but in real

application

these mechanisms can interact with each

other

for example in the fresh device the

electric field peak is formed near the

field blade edge

which is a similar to the ideal case

but with the increase with the severe

electron trapping in the surface state

or a gallium nitride fee now the

electric field profile can be changed

and the depletion region can be pushed

up

once it becomes severe now the local

electric field spike can be formed near

the drain ends and because of this

electric field spike now the hot car

injection effect can be accelerated

and this behavior is actually observed

in actual measurement

so if you see this bottom figure

in the lower tza condition the el peak

is

observed near the field platelets which

is similar to the ideal case or the

fresh device case

with increasing the drain voltage now

the yield signal is pushed out and it

difficult the real high voltage now the

yield peak is mainly observed near the

drainage which is similar to this last

figure

so as you can see in this example the

understanding each trapping mechanism

and also understanding the interaction

of these mechanisms can give us a clear

and better picture of the device

reliability in actual operation

so in the following section we're going

to review the application level

reliability which is more relevant to

the real ucs

then how can you evaluate the

application level reliability

one straightforward way is to stress

devices in actual circuits

and the stress time should be low enough

to guarantee certain level of

reliability

and there have been several publications

which are aligned to this aspect

so in this left figure the affordable to

gain devices were stressed in the 8-1

converter circuits

for 20 000 hours uh during this

evaluation the maximum adjacent

degradation was saturated at about

eleven percent and uh no device failed

in the right paper now 650 volt again

devices uh were stressed in the septic

converter for 3000 hours at 150 degrees

c

and during this test neither of uh

serious artisan degradation or the

leakage current increase was observed

as another example the efficiency of the

gain converter circuit was monitored for

3000 hours at 175 degrees c and as you

can see in this figure the converter

circuit shows excellent

stability

so as you can see in these examples the

one obvious way to

validate the application level

reliability is to build a circuit

and run a long phone task

but everybody uses different circuits

and different different bias conditions

basically there is no standard

related to this issue one important

question is whether there is any

fundamental stress mode in actual

applications

which can be difficult to be covered in

the device level test

and if yes we need to understand the

stress mode and develop more standard

way to evaluate

so let's check what kinds of stress

modes exist in actual applications

so this left figure shows a typical half

bridge circuit and this right figure

shows the device operation modes that we

reviewed so there are three operation

modes on state of state and the third

quadrant and during the switching

between on and off state either of a

hard switching or the self ceiling

transition

is possible depending on circuit

policies and controller circuits

so let's first check the high to load

transition of this switching node so

initially the high side thread is on and

the low side thread is off so the

current flows from the v-in to the

inductor through the high side valve

and now once the high side fat turns off

the current through the high side fat

drops and then the switching node

potential drops so the radius of high

side that increases

so during this transition the high side

that goes through this soft switching

transition

supports the current drops and then

drain voltage increases

in the case of the low side fab

to maintain the inductor current it goes

through the

uh

it starts from the off state and goes to

the third quadrant and once the device

turns off it goes down state

so in this high to low transition there

is no special stress mode which is

difficult to be covered in the device

level test

then let's see now the low tide

transition

so now the high side fat is off and the

low side fed is on so the inductor

current go through the load and the low

side fat

so once the high side fat turns on the

current starts to increase in the low

high side fat under high drain voltage

and once the the soft switching load

potential goes up now the radius of the

high side that decreases

so this during this transition the high

side effect goes through this hard

switching transition so under high drain

voltage current force increases and then

drainable tc drops

and this hard switching transition is

particularly stressful because both high

electric field and high current coexist

so a lot of hot carriers can be

generated during this hard switching

transition

and also the high the idt and dvdt of

the gain circuit can push this hard

switching

locus to the close to the soa boundary

and since this hard switching transition

occurs in many different circuit

topologies such as a boost converter

bulk converter and torrent pfc

it can be regarded as a fundamental

stress mode in actual applications

then

let's check whether the traditional

device level qualification can cover

this hard switching transition

so if you see this table

there are three main

device level reliability tests

so first hdgb is for the on state so

htrb is for the offstate

and aceto is for switching but it does

not require hard switching transition

and both academia and the industry

recognized this gap

and tried to develop a test vehicle to

evaluate the hard switching robustness

so in the first paper the inductor and

resistor loads were used to generate

this hard switching transition

the second paper uses the pure inductive

load switching the third one uses the

register and the capacitor is your road

to generate this hard switching

transition

although there are some differences in

the circuit designs the main purposes

are all same

the introducing the hard switching

stress on the test device to evaluate

the device robustness under this stress

and this slide shows the

usefulness of the hard switching test

vehicle

so the devices shown in this slide will

pass the traditional device level

qualification including the htgb htrb

and h2o without hard switching

transition

and this device is now stressed with by

using this inductive load hard switching

test vehicle

and only one device passed

the criteria

so these production grade devices showed

a stable rds zone over 1000 hours under

40 volt heart switching at 150 degrees c

but other devices from type a or type b

group

showed a lot of variations in the rds

and performance and also some of the

devices

failed due to the soa

and this data suggests that the

traditional device level qualification

does not guarantee the hard switching

robustness

and these devices are also evaluated in

actual hybrid applications

and consistent to the horizon test

vehicle result the production grade

device showed excellent stability over a

thousand hours

while the devices from the type a group

showed the over temperature forth due to

the severe rdst increase and also

devised from the type group also shows

some drift in the efficiency

and this confirms that the hard

switching test vehicle can be a good

representation for the stress in real

applications

in addition to the

effort to develop the hard switching

test vehicle there are several recent

studies to build a switching reliability

model in gallium nitride

so in this paper

the multiple different the impact of the

multiple different factors such as the

temperature and drain voltage and

switching current were studied

and these impacts on the switching

lifetime were implemented as a model and

by using this model you can predict the

device lifetime depending on the

switching low cost

there is another paper

which proposed a general method to cover

the different switching conditions

so as you can see in this left figure

the amount of the switching stress was

calculated by using this formula the

product of the drain voltage switching

current and overlap time and some

acceleration factors

and by using this formula the one of the

switching

energy among the switching stress was

calculated in different switching

conditions and the device lifetime was

projected

so based on all these efforts the jfp

180.01 was published recently which

describes a standard way

to evaluate the switching reliability in

gan devices

so there are two main categories the

first one is a switching acceleration

live test which is basically the device

lifetime modeling under switching

so similar to the previous papers we

need to use some accelerations to

understand the wearable mechanism and

predict the device lifetime

the second one is the dynamic edge tool

which is very similar to the h2o but now

the hard switching transition is

required

so the maximum operation voltage and the

current laser are recommended for

thousand hours to demonstrate

demonstrate the stability of the device

under high switching stress

so that was the reliability

in normal operation condition but in

actual applications there is another

area that we need to cover which is the

auto so event

the external electric shock or some

controller port can trigger the auto

vessel events

and the high did t and dvd of gain

circuit can occasionally introduce the

voltage or current surge stress

and power devices

are required to survive under these auto

so events for a certain amount of the

time

but you may think that it might be more

challenging for gan devices to handle

these out of s3 events

because first the letter gain device

doesn't have evidence breakdown so there

is some concern for the robustness under

the voltage search

and also the

electric device structure and the high

current density

uh can limit the robustness under the

short circuit event

so in the case of the robustness under

the voltage source there has been

concern due to the lack of ambulance but

in reality it is not big problem

so different from the conventional

silicon power devices whose voltage

rating is determined based on the about

80 percent defined as about 80 percent

of the actual breakdown workpiece the

gain device breakdown voltage is much

higher than the target operational

voltage

so the properly designed gain devices

can handle the

surge voltage surge stress without

causing any serious issues

so if this paper studies the

robustness of the 600 volt gain device

under 720 volt surge stress

so if you see this uh top right figure

the gain devices were stressed under 400

volt input voltage

and this info voltage was suddenly

increased from 400 volts to the 720 volt

but gan devices uh switch it under this

720 volt surge event without any problem

and even after 50 strikes

there was no change in efficiency

however

some weakness under the short circuit

event was observed especially in the

standalone again device

when the stress voltage is relatively

low the devices show the excellent

stability but if it was higher voltage

the short circuit with stand time was

less than 10 microseconds which is

actually worse than typical silicon

power devices or silicon carbide devices

so in this aspect the system level

reliability is very important in the

gallium nitride for example

the integrated gate driver solution can

provide multiple smart gig functions

such as fast over temperature or over

current detection

and it can prevent the potential

reliability such as a short circuit and

provide a more stable

and complete solution

so we have a review of various aspects

of the reliability in the can devices

and understanding these potential life

issues and

underlying mechanisms allow us to define

the design space and push the device

performance with meeting the required

reliability

so at the initial stage of the

technology development the meeting the

reliability is the main goal

but but we did now with the successful

technology qualification and

commercialization people start to focus

more on expanding the potential of this

technology

so in the last section uh we'll switch

gears and review the recent innovations

which can push the scan technology to

the next level

so one path to expand the potential of

the gun technology

is to increase the integration level

by integrating the gate driver with the

main power fat we can remove the

parasitic inductance in the gay loop and

improve the switching performance

so initially it was done by co-packaging

the silicon gate driver without gallium

nitride power device

but now it's moving toward the on-chip

integration which builds the both the

gate driver and the power device on the

same gallium nitride chip

and there has been successful

commercialization with this approach

and for the

gate driver design with the gallium

nitride the dcfl is which uses a

depletion mode and fat and the

investment with the empath is mainly

used

but to use a conventional cmos circuit

we need the enhancement mode of p5

although there are still many technical

challenges to make a good investment

mode of pfas such as low hold mobility

or poor contact resistance there has

been good progress in this area

so if you see this right figure

so by using the pgan region of the gas

tag in the conventional

e-mode power device

global tcp fab was fabricated

to push the vt the

recessed gate structure was used and to

increase the gate voltage of threshold

voltage water the undoped gallium

nitride where some plasma treatments

were applied

and as you can see in the right figures

the decent device performance and the

initial inverter operation were

successfully demonstrated

another

path to inc to increase the integration

level in the game technology is in power

loop

since the gantt device is a leather

device we can build the high side and

low side effects on the same chip

but there is a one problem so if you put

the high side and low side fats on the

same chip now they share the

same buffer and the substrate and in gan

technology there is no pure anal

isolation

so in the high bridge operation once the

high side thread is on the high side

channel potential goes up and there is a

vertical electric field between the high

side of the channel and the substrate

which depletes the two deck channel in

the high side fat so this can cause the

increase in conduction loss of the high

side fat

so to solve this problem the monolithic

integration on soi vapor was

demonstrated so here now the high side

bed and low side fats were built on the

soi vapor

and the top silicon was isolated by

using this deep trench chat

so in this technology effectively the

high side and low side effects are

sitting on different substrates

so this approach is quite interesting

and i think it's innovative but there

are still

some room for additional improvement

for example

the process complexity can increase in

this approach because of the

soi wafer and this deep trench etch

and also there can be some some

limitation because of the poor thermal

conductivity of the buried oxide

so if you go the one step further in

terms of the integration level now we

can build everything that we mentioned

before into on the single chip

so if you see this speaker the gate

driver high side fat and low side fat

were integrated on a single gallium

nitride chip

and this can provide the best form

factor and also maximize the switching

performance

in addition to the innovation to

increasing the integration level we can

also add more functionality by adding

the in-situ sensing capability

for example by adding the two deck

resistor in the middle of the power fab

we can use it as a temperature sensor

and it can provide the faster over

temperature detection function

similarly now the sense that can be

integrated in the middle power fab by

sharing the gate and the source nodes

with the main fab

and by using the send spec current we

can estimate the perfect current uh and

this can be used

for the zero current or over current

detection which can improve the safety

and efficiency of the entire system

and also there has been continuous

research

on the new gallium nitride device

structure

so similar to the silicon 3d structure

can provide additional freedom to

improve the device performance in

gallium nitride

as exact for example the by stacking the

heater structures multiple true deck

channels can be formed as you can see in

this figure

and to control these multiple channels

the trigate and the 3d field plate

concept were demonstrated as you can see

in this figure

and thanks to the multiple channels

this device

shows a much better rsp

within meeting the same breakdown

voltage requirement

so this is a one good example

to show the new device structure can

push the gain gain technology

performance significant significantly

lastly there has been continuous effort

to scale up the gallium nitride wafers

in current gain industry either of a six

inch or eight inch gun vapors are used

but about two years ago in this

conference 12.2 gallon silicon

technology was published

although user mainly for the rfo

applications which requires relatively

thin buffer the excellent two-day

uniformity occurs so across the 12-inch

vapor shows the potential of the gallium

nitride vapor scaling

i think that brings me to the summary of

this tutorial so the can technology is

not the future technology anymore so

fast and the widespread market adoption

is happening

and it has it's uh it's possible thanks

to the extensive research to understand

the potential reliable issues and

underlying mech reliability mechanisms

and also there has been continuous

effort to demonstrate the robustness of

this technology by setting out new

standards such as switching reliability

and with the continuous improvement in

the reliability the gan technology is

evolving in multiple directions in both

device and system levels

and it's expected that the scan

technology can push the power

electronics to the next level and open

up the new area

before finishing this talk i'd like to

thank ti gang development team

and

i think that's pretty much of it thank

you very much for all your attention

thank you

thank you very much for this nice talk

uh

again we have some time here uh for some

questions if you come please

go to the microphone state name and

affiliation and then

yeah

open four questions

thank you for very nice talk i'm taking

a minute from cornell so can you please

comment on the tdb issue in game night

ride on grammar and vertical devices as

you know in vertical garmin natural

devices recently the

queer avalanche breakdown is achieved

from the many groups

but the in your presentations you

mentioned about the time dependent

direct breakdown

limits their device performance of their

gallon silicon lateral devices would you

please comment on these issues for

vertical devices

yes so this presentation is mainly for

the electric and devices which

in this device we don't see the

avalanche breakdown but as you mentioned

the vertical gan power devices you can

build a pn junction and you can actually

see the avalanche breakdown in that case

now you need to think about the both tdd

issue and avalanche breakdown so

in the case

in some voltage you may not see the

avalanche breakdown because the voltage

is not reached a critical electric field

but still the device can fail in the

depletion reason because of the tdp

issue so

the actual maximum operational voltage

can be limited by actual tdb not the

avalanche breakdown also in the

political devices and i think this can

be a good research area yeah thank you

other questions

so uh hello my name is from uh global

ticket solutions

um maybe uh if you could comment because

it was not entirely clear to me for all

the

for all the different uh reliability

mechanisms that

bti uh

mbtip bti hot carrier

which ones

for which one has been some recovery

observed and which ones are permanent

so in the case of tddb these are

permanent so once the tdp happens

you cannot

recover that damage in the case of a

dynamic rds zone is recoverable

so if you stop switching and leave the

device the electron trapping the

electrons trapped in the

trap sites can be detract and the rdsm

can be recovered uh also the threshold

voltage instability also can be

recovered so it's uh of course uh it

actually is a depends so if the stress

voltage is relatively low the most of

the threshold wtc shift can be recovered

but if you go to the whole if the stress

voltage is goes above a certain level

you can start to introduce some

permanent damage and you can see the

actual

semi-permanent shift in the threshold

voltage

did i answer your question

thank you for the very interesting talk

uh you said one of the challenges about

p-fed is uh related to contact

resistivity

is it related to the the fact that the

channel is indulged and if yes is there

a way to

overcome this challenge

can you comment on this

yes so

so one one of the big challenges the the

main dopants in the p-gan is a magnesium

and the maximum level is relatively high

so as i mentioned

in the slide

if even though you doped

for example 1 in 19

level actual whole density is pretty low

so

if you make the contact on this p gap

the barrier height the

the

tunneling width can be quite high

because of the effective lower doping

level

which caused the high contact resistance

so i think i don't remember the exact

matter but there is a certain kind of

matter which can provide a relatively

good contact resistance for the p-type

gallium p-type gallium nitride but now

the main challenge is the integration

with the main power pack

hi michael hunt from ime um just so you

mentioned about a whole bunch of this

instability in gang

about traps was there a systematic study

of the traps in in gang like what are

the traps is it intrinsic traps

exercising traps uh what are the truck

energy levels has that been a systematic

study

yes so there are a lot of studies on the

trap levels and for example

the 0.9 eb 0.3b kind of traps are widely

measured widely measured on the gallium

nitride especially for the

the dynamic rds zone rvt instability

and but at the same time

[Music]

you may see the different trap levels

depending on how you measure and how you

grow the fb so that's the one of the key

challenges how to manage these traps in

the gallium nitride and also even though

there are traps we need to

control and uh and also if you

if the form level is not close to that

for that trap level it's not effective

so which does not actually impact on

device performance so that's another way

to handle this trap issues in the

gallium nitride so then then how do you

minimize i mean if you can't

really don't understand what our traps

are present then how do you suppress it

yeah for example

when i

mentioned about the gallium natural

epigraphs carbon is uh is used to

make insulating buffer but actually if

you increase the carbon level it can

degrade the crystal quality

and

previously the carbon doping is mainly

done by the

institute doping

which means that if you lower the gross

temperature of the gallium nitride the

carbon is automatically doped through

the

the carrier gas but since uh but to

increase the carbon level you need to

use a lower growth temperature which can

cause the degradation of the crystal

quality and create a lot of traps

so now the people start to use the the

external source for the carbon so now

you have an external carbon source so

you can increase the growth temperature

to maintain the high quality gallium

nitride and you are controlling the

carbon level by using the those of the

external source so this is one way to

optimize the

crystal quality and also maintain the

the device structure that the device

designers want to okay thank you

patrick cabinson from bennec

thank you for your talk very

comprehensive

just general question you didn't detail

the enhanced um the two enhancement

modes so you focused on peak and gate

how do you compare the

recessed mesent and pig and gate in

terms of reability and also integration

like when you have all these different

functions you want to make

yes so the reason why i focus the p game

based emo device in this presentation is

the is most of the commercial again

device e-mode gain devices adopt peak

and gate of course there are also active

research on other approaches

for example the recessed gate structure

has various advantages in terms of

device performance because

in the p-g-engage structure to make a

threshold voltage positive you need to

reduce the two deck density uh which

degrades the own resistance but in the

case of the recessed gauge structure you

can maintain the same product density in

the access region so there is a

definitive benefit in our device are

already sold again the problem is again

the stability of the threshold voltage

and controllability so when you do the

recess for to make a threshold voltage

positive

you can degrade the 2d movie under the

gate and now now you need to think about

whether this is a beneficial for the

entire device resistance because even

though you can increase you can get

better access resist excess region

resistance but you are degrading the

resistance in the channel reason

now another challenge in the recessed

case structure is as i mentioned with

the slide the threshold instability so

even though you can achieve the positive

vt at time zero but after high voltage

stress the vt can be shifted and

the big device can become the depletion

mode device so this uh these kind of

reliable issues need to be handled in

the other approaches so maybe less

mature maybe
