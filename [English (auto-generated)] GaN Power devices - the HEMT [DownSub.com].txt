okay now that we know roughly how

there's a hetero structure works let's

focus on devices which I think are much

more interesting and in particular on

the this is a very general one depending

on where your highlight if it is then

you would design a proper proper

structure with probably designed in

plates but in general what it is

important to know this is the main

structure you start from so what you

have is a fourth terminal device you

have source and drain which are ohmic

contacts a substrate contact and you

have a Schottky gate

it's a hetero structure base as we've

seen it's a normally-on device no I

don't know if you're familiar with nan

lian above definition but normally phone

means that without applying any voltage

the channel is already formed so and

it's here so if you have any voltage

applied on the drain you will see

current flowing in the device with zero

bias on the gate and this is something

that people are working in say kids do

not like too much because they might

have shot the kid put 0 for 0 bias

applied if the reason was shooting on

the drain and the distance the the high

electric field is generally stays

between the gate and the end the drain

so this is the drift region of the

device it's a lateral structure so let's

try to understand these devices made we

have field plates you are familiar with

the plates the way in which they are

designed three depends on your structure

and whether to fill is formed the way

where the high electric field is is

which it's in most of the structures is

on the drain side of the gate contact

and

to the drain contact so these two are

the critical points and most of the

times indeed what you have is a feed

plate on the gate which is extended from

the gates to the drain and next are

filled plates on top are connected to

the source on top of the gate in some

case it's not always the case but in

some cases I've seen field plates on the

drain as well to really release the

pressure of the electric field on the

drain side passivation layers and we

know why we have position areas one

reason is because we need to fill plate

and so we need them to to release the

electric field and to improve the offset

performance of the device another reason

and you will see why in a bit is to

release the first layer of passivation

is as shown to give better properties to

the surface of the device so if you have

a passivation the properties of this

possession will affect the properties of

this interface top layer which in this

case is a gang cap passivation

so it's a very important crucial layer

and the second position three is just

simply a final position of the device

which is to be called a very kind of

device the most common material used is

a silicon nitride with different going

technique either low pressure or plasma

enhanced CVD the gun cap we mentioned it

already I think now it becomes clearer

why we have it I'm in off States we

don't want any current going through the

gate if you have a layer of gunk up this

is how it is called you have you block

the leakage going through the gates but

we have seen that there is a trade-off

to that thickness typical thicknesses I

think I didn't invite them fear typical

thicknesses are in between three and

seven nanometers no more than that

otherwise okay

nice the Alan gonna cross structure we

know why we have it there it's because

we want a high electron density in the

channel given the pizza polarity of the

of the material the thickness of the of

the argon as we seen before will define

the value of the 2dec concentration you

have but this buffer layer that you see

between the gun and the substrate is a

very important piece of design of the

material unfortunately father wisest

people do not people that design devices

do not have access to this layer because

it's really a secret of the foundry and

they are very helpful not to disclose

anything because it's what will

determine the properties of the gun and

the pure the gun layer is the peptide

electrical properties of the material

with E and these depend on - this buffer

layer and the reason of that is because

you have if you are talking about

silicon based gun on a child devices so

grown on the silicon substrate you have

to adapt the properties of the silicon

to the ones of the gun in order not to

have any any defects in the so there are

several ways of having this buffer layer

and one is you can have single layer of

aluminum nitride or aluminum gallium

nitrite but this is not the most popular

at the moment at least from what I know

because given that it's a secret most of

the times and another way of doing it is

by creating a super lattice structure

which means you have several layers done

and alg√∫n one on top of each other

another one which I didn't mention here

we have seen actually myself is you have

first day of aluminum nitride and then

aluminum a fraction which will decrease

towards zero to adapt the lumen I tried

the gun so you'll have several layers of

argon with decreasing amount volume

concentration or the way from onion I

tried to the gun yeah and it seems this

protects the gun from the problems of

his interface substrate we have we have

different possibilities as a substrate

supplier silicon carbide and silicon for

each of this substrate I I put down some

pros and cons for the sand pie it's very

good because it seemed insulating so can

withstand high growth temperatures and

it's relatively cheap it has a lot I'm a

conductivity and large lattice mismatch

which means that when you grow the gun

on top of it it has the mismatch in

temperature coefficient does not create

issues within the boundary silicon

carbide the silicon carbide a substrate

has a high thermal conductivity which is

one of the very good properties of

silicon carbide in general so you won't

need a seminal heatsink for lowing down

the temperature of the device and has a

low lattice mismatch but it has quite

expensive and the silicon it's our

Hewlett one and the only way to convince

people the gonna nitride can't replace

actually silicon because of the cost

because of the cost and the normal

related to this technology so what my

research and my group and most the

groups are focusing on at the moment if

gallium nitride on silicon

because there the ability of a lot of

diameters of substrates however the the

problems with the substrate is large

lattice mismatch and large coefficient

of temperature expansion a mismatch and

is why we have buffer layer though to

alleviate this problem operation mode of

the device we have four bias conditions

one is zero bias nothing is applied to

the device

we have the channel is formed we said

it's a normally on device

nothing is pretty much happening on

States keeping the gate at zero because

the channel is already formed with zero

bias indicates increasing the drain bias

we have current flowing into the devices

of course the gate bias has to be higher

than threshold voltage which will be

negative and lower than the Schottky

turn-on voltage because this is a

Schottky gate so if you increase the

voltage above the opening the voltage

which determines the opening of the

Schottky contact you will have current

flowing into the gate which you clearly

don't want off state that kid has to go

with an attraction voltage values of

trash unbolted for this kind of devices

are of the order of minus two maximum

minus three so if you put a gate at

minus five minus seven you have your

device in in upstate so he depletes the

channel under the gate and of course

blocking mode we're talking about very

high voltage on the drain and gate of

negative bias biases below the threshold

voltage what happens in this a situation

is that the two then gets depleted from

the gate to the drain into the drain as

increase the drain bias and I think it's

worth mentioning that as you see all the

charge is confined in the two deck so to

switch that off to the period and form

the channel is everything is extremely

fast it doesn't involve any injection or

removal of

education region it's extremely fast

switching device

okay okay so before I start I just want

to spend a few more minutes on the on

the structure and the operation of much

of the structure so I don't know how

clear it is the fact that when you have

obtunded already formed you need to

apply a negative bias to deplete the

negative charge underneath and so as we

were mentioning we have already that

shown out there we had to apply a

negative bias on the gate here it is V 0

this will deplete the channel beneath

the gate contact and will for a cut the

connection between the two dimensional

electron gas which is present from the

gates to the source source and the one

between the gate and the drain so for

any train voltage applied you shouldn't

see any current flowing into the device

unless it's leakage current and we will

see where it comes from a while if the

drain by has its very high you had the

question of the two tech also in the

drift region which is the one going from

the gate to the train up to the point

which all the two deck is is depleted

and the electric field picks most of the

time is next to the trailer and 20

microns independent doping because we do

have some p-type doping for avoiding

leakage from the source to drain punch

through leakage that we will see general

is 15 I would say it's in between

Trivium between 10x Levitch shorter

doesn't reach 10 10 is too big because

the thicker it is the lowers it to the

concentration C and Phi 3 and 7 I've

seen 7 as well and the argon is between

12 and 22 I would say 18 19 not typical

values

yeah so the dimension of the gate is 1

micrometer to gate itself and in general

the field played it's 1 2 micrometers

from 1.5 it really depends on your

electric field though how long this thin

plate is but it's in between 1 & 2

they won't say the resistance is given

it's calculated in as a from there from

the to death yes depending on the

thickness of the layers above and if you

have any doping in the structure which

you do p-type I would see it later

because you want to block the leakage

current from the source to the drain and

that's why it's very low because you

have high density to channel electron a

higher electron channel concentration

concentration is yeah this is why

potential is very powerful myself in the

structure and yes the current flows only

in this confined quantum world

yes that's why go to the mobility is

very high but if you think about the

values of mobility in the gun itself

it's around 700 which is not higher than

silicon which is 1300 something but it

reaches 2000

just because of the suction itself and

the polarization of the material both

transfer characteristics which is ID VG

and output characteristics so you have

the ID VG which is on the device which

is on per negative gate voltages and it

opens this dropping in the current is

because the Schottky gate has been

switched on so as soon as there is

current flowing into the gate the

current through the drain decreases

abruptly and this is what you see if you

go for higher for too high today this

value is around one volt in general so a

3-2 minus 2.5 on the threshold voltage

and one watt as the Schottky contact the

electron current as is a bit and flows

to the to deck and laterally from the

source to the drain according to the

convention from the drain to the source

and these are the got family of the cat

feces so it looks exactly the best that

I would say field effect transistor it's

just that it's based on this hetero

structure and on the probabilities of

the of the gun one thing we have to

mention and I have to go back a little

bit into the physics for doing that is

the origin of the two-dimensional

electron gas we've seen that we have a

very high electron concentration in the

in device but it's if you calculate that

charge adjust accordingly to the

polarization charge and electric keep in

the structure and then you measure your

device and don't see the resistance and

then the from that extrapolated actual

value we're having the device most of

the cases you have even higher

concentration of electrons than one

predicted by theory the reason of that

is because you have I think let me go

back just one second you have this

interface between the silicon nitride

and the gun cap order

depending which is the layer at the top

you have this interface which is crucial

is very important what the city's

interface are in most of the case the

defects so these defects which are also

called traps don't know if like traps

now I don't know how much familiar you

are with traps but you can imagine them

being being that energy level from the

conduction band for example has it is

here being a reservoir of carriers if

it's donors as soon as they have enough

energy to get ionized which means to

release the electrons from this energy

level to the conduction band then they

are providing electron to the to the

structure and this providing of

electrons will it will reinforce the

two-dimensional electron gas this is one

of the theories related to the very high

concentration of electrons in the

channel you can have all kinds of

distributions of op donors the single

one is the uniform it's the single level

which you have on the left hand side

picture so you have just one energy

level of carriers you need the

conduction band providing electrons and

one which is a little bit more

complicated it's a uniform distribution

in energy which you have you have the

you you will have their unit addition of

these traps depending on the only

voltage drop it is that is interphase

why they are so important we don't have

to forget about talking about what

vanghoul material so you don't you won't

have many lectures coming from the

valence band to the conduction band

ten minutes excited because depending up

for the argon is around

concentration of home - it's around four

point three for that aluminum nitride a

six point two so it's even higher why if

you have energy levels let's say point

two point four from the conduction band

then you need mushroom energy to have

excitation of electrons from the

energy from the adora energy level to

the conduction band so now we can

understand why we have what is equation

gives you this value which is much

better than the one for silicon carbide

and silicon silicon based devices we

have high electron mobility why do we

have it I think now should be clear we

have lots of electrons in the two

dimensional electron gas not scattering

with any with any tokens and being

confined in that quantum well which was

shown before we have high electron

concentration and the critical electric

field is higher because of the wider

band gap of the material
