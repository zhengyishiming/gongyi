so I'm here in the home ship fab and I

want to show you a pretty simple way to

measure the thickness of thin films that

are on the order of a few nanometers to

a few microns using only an optical

spectrometer that I picked up off eBay

like everything else here and white

light source so before I go into how it

actually works I'll just give you a

quick demo I've got it set up with a 1

centimeter square silicon that I've

coated with about a 750 nanometers layer

of photoresist the photoresist was spin

coated and it's a pretty easy way of

getting a calibration standard with a

liquid of known viscosity and if you

spin it onto the wafer at a known rpm

then you should get a pretty repeatable

thickness in my case I was using this

resist in red which is this trace spun

at about 4000 rpm which gives a film of

roughly speaking here 750 nanometers and

if we go over to a little python script

I wrote right now we're looking at a

bear piece of silicon so it's not

getting the expected spectrum but if I

just use the XY table here and I move

the microscope and position it to look

at the sample we want to analyze we come

back over here and notice there's a

bunch of Peaks it's found those Peaks

with little markers at the maximum

minimum points and then given that

spectra it's done some math which I'll

show you and it said that our films

about eight hundred and twenty

nanometers in thickness which is in

pretty good agreement with the 700

nanometers we expect this is great in

the process of making chips you have to

deposit and etch a number of thin films

of varying thicknesses onto your

substrate for instance when you're

growing an oxide like an insulator onto

the wafer you put it in this furnace

here and you can guess to what the end

point will be based on like the time and

temperature and humidity and everything

like that but there's a lot of factors

and you'll never get it quite right so

it's really nice to actually get a real

qualitative quantitative value rather

and you can stop guessing about some of

these parameters and be more scientific

about it this is a really overkill set

up believe me that most of the stuff

here is not necessary it's just kind of

cluttering the picture here this system

that I use is a wafer probers it's got

these like sharp and you don't point

tips and you can put them on a silicon

wafer to kind of probe it but that's not

important I'm just using it for its

microscope here and kind of stir

debase you could build this with like

some kind of LED lamp and then a

spectrometer for the spectrometer I've

got this ocean optics sts UV visible

spectrometer they're on eBay for like

$400 or so you can get them for a little

less if you're a patient I think and

there are a lot of other options you're

mainly looking to analyze light in the

range of say four hundred to a thousand

nanometers any band of that that's about

400 or 500 nanometers why is good for

these kind of measurements a wider band

is of course a lot better because you

can get more measurements across that

band and and kind of average it so I

have a illuminator that's just like a

halogen light bulb inside this standard

microscope illuminator comes to this

fiber-optic neck gooseneck thing shines

down in axis with the microscope comes

out the objective hits the sample and

then that light comes right back up in

the same axis and some is split off for

the eyepieces of course which isn't

really important and the rest of it goes

into this spectrometer the way this

actually works as it relies on thin film

interference when you look at a silicon

wafer that has a film on it they often

have these beautiful iridescent kind of

shiny colors and that's because the thin

film interference kind of selects these

wavelengths very sharply it's like a

very sharp filter around specific

wavelengths so that's why it gives you

such a brilliant beautiful colors

stained glass windows have a similar

effect but two different different

mechanisms to get these sharp bins of

color

dichroic filters and optics utilize this

and that's why there have a really

really sharp on and off cut in any case

we have a film of some thickness and

different wavelengths will go through

that film or be reflected off that film

with different intensities so that's all

we're measuring here is kind of the

relative intensity of all these

different wavelengths and then if we

have some Python script or whatever that

finds the period of this so you can

select these little markers and that can

be done really simply we just have some

input I'm taking the derivative of it in

the software and then wherever the

derivative crosses zero we have like a

maximum or minimum and

the more of these markers you have you

can kind of average your measurement

over a longer field and get more

accurate measurements we're only picking

up three points here and the fourth one

we're missing for some reason those

software problem but when you know the

period of this kind of sinusoidal egg it

into this formula and you can magically

get the thickness out if you know the

refractive index of the material a

little more precisely what's going on

here is a classic demonstration of

interference you can see in this picture

we have a thin film that represented by

the color red and we have two different

wave lengths so again just for a

simplified demonstration in reality it's

a white light with a spectrum of them

which is pretty important just for

example will consider the blue light

coming on some of those blue photons

bounce off the top surface of the thin

film and some of them go through the

entire thickness of the film they bounce

off the surface of the substrate instead

that means one of the rays of light has

got a longer path length and therefore

with respect to the other one is phase

shifted a little bit

so when both rays come out of the thin

film at roughly the same angle and they

recombined with each other one is

shifted a bit and they can

constructively or destructively

interfere in this example here we can

see destructive interference with the

blue one and constructive interference

with the red one so you can imagine

where the sinusoidal kind of spectra

comes from on our spectrometer so some

of these wavelengths are coming out of

the film unarmed another wavelengths are

kind of being filtered out and old

here's the equation I used to convert

the spectrometer data to usable

thickness measurements you give it n the

refractive index Delta M the number of

Peaks you can count and then lambda 2

lambda 1 or the window in which you're

counting those peaks and nanometers and

microns whatever unit you want theta is

the angle of incidence of the light

going to the spectrometer off the wafer

surface and I can simplify the left-hand

side of this in my case to Delta M over

2 and grab a sample that was coated with

some thicker photoresist that was more

viscous and this in theory is about a 2

micron film 2.0 something so to measure

a new sample I just put it under there

and

we'll move over the XY stage to kind of

focus on the sample we want to look at

the sample is a broken fragment of a

chip I made but it's coated in

photoresist so it's perfect for this

having the eyepiece on this microscope

setup is nice for alignment I can get

like this focus spot and I can measure

the thickness of a film anywhere on it

which is pretty nice

let me head over to the same Python

script before it's correctly identified

like these Peaks and then we can see

that it says the thickness is a little

over two microns which is great

you know that's within the margin of

error of the RPM of my spinny thing the

viscosity of the resist the measurement

error of everything so I'm good with

that

and that shows that it's working quite

well that's about all I have it was kind

of a short video but I hope you enjoyed

it I have a couple more coming up that I

think you'll like and I hope everyone is

staying healthy and safe in these crazy

times I think it's good to be able to

work on things if you can and stay busy

with projects next steps for this are

kind of obvious if I can motorized this

XY stage here or put it on like a 3d

printer or something then I should be

able to make 3d topology maps of a

surface which would be super cool and I

could put away fur in it and see how

uniform the spin coating processes and

compared to like how good it is in

industry which is supposedly on the

order of like angstroms like actually uh

within a few atomic layers across the

wafer surface which is amazing but we'll

see how good I can do it in here so

anyway hope you learn something and

enjoy the video and thanks for watching
