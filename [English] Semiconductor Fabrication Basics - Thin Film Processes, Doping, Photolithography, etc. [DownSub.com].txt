Hi, so I'm going to be making creating 3 videos,
this is the first of which where I'll be covering

the Semiconductor Fabrication Basics

So I'll be going through an overview of all
of the steps required to make semiconductors,

and then Ill be going to go a little more
in depth in to each one of those, and talk

about how the process works and the tools
that are used to do that process

In the next video, i'm going to show you how
you can do some of those processes at home,

on a low budget in a non clean-room environment
so basically setting up a home chip lab.

And then in the third video, I'll be going
step by step in _my_ home setup, either making

a diode or a transistors or maybe a NOR gate,
step-by-step through that, and that's probably

be a long video, and that will give you a
more of a hands-on for you for all of these

steps.

To make the most sense out of these video's
you should already have a basic understanding

of terminology like doping, p-type, n-type,
charge carrier mobility, you should be familiar

with wafers crystal orientation , ,
and the major and minor flats associated with

them.

All of that you can easily find on-line if
you just look up semiconductor basics and

stuff like that.

OK, let's go over a quick overview of all
of the steps

Right here I have a drawing on how I manufacture
NMOS FETs, these are N-type metal-oxide semiconductor

field effect transistors, basically n-channel
MOSFETS.

And you start with a P-type  orientation
wafer, the first step is called oxidation,

this is a field oxide, and I grow on top of
it a layer of silicon dioxide, SiO2, and that's

basically sand or glass or whatever you want
to call it, it's very very pure and it's a

dielectric and its an insulator, and this
is very very important, these layers are used

for passivation (so protection), for insulation
between multiple structures that you are building

onto the wafer, and also more importantly
they are used for the gate oxide of the FET

here.

So the first step, I grow this insulating
layer right here on top of the wafer, and

I'll talk about how that's done, there's a
few methods of doing that, the one that I

want for a field oxide its called, this is
the first thick oxide here, I want about 500nm

(5000A) thick and that'll be a blueish color
due to thin film interference.

The next step, I apply a mask to the wafer,
and then dunk it in a hydrofluoric acid solution

that then etches away these active areas into
that SiO2 layer so we are left with the wafer

with these regions of insulator on top of
them but then these regions in between are

bare silicon.

Before you etch it in HF acid, if you want
to clean up the wafer a little bit more you

can do a surface treatment with "piranha"
sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide and theres

also RCA clean parts 1 and 2, theres some
pretty nasty chemicals in there so be you

have to be very careful...

The third step is the doping, so I spin-coat
a dopant and for N-type doping -I want to

make these N-type wells here- that would be
a phosphorous solution, so for this you can

take phosphoric acid, and you can put it into
water or if you want it to spin-coat even

nicer you can use an alcohol solvent.

Filmtronics sells pre-made spin-on diffusants
and so does Emulsitone, but for both those

companies its very pricey, and you can only
get it in large quantities so you should get

on with making your own... and you can spin-coat
this by placing it on a rotating motor at

around 3000RPM and you put this film onto
it and it will spread across so this is one

method of doping here and after thats on there
you do pre-deposition and you put it in a

furnace for about half an hour and it drives
in the phosphorous atoms, so this is one method

of doping called diffusion and it's in the
past years mostly been replaced with ion implantation,

other techniques, but this is the easiest
way to do doping at home, so once we have

N-type doped wells here, then we grow back
a gate oxide, so we grow another layer of

SiO2 very thin in the middle here, and then
we make connections to the Drain, Source and

Gate regions and the body of the MOSFET connects
up to the source.

To make the masks that I was talking about
up here, theres a process called photo-lithography

where you take a wafer you coat it with a
photosensitive paint called photo-resist,

and then you put a mask on top or in proximity
of the wafer, or with projection systems the

mask is further away with some very complicated
optics, but to keep it simple I'll say you

put the mask on top of the wafer and then
you expose very high intensity UV light on

to that wafer with the masks on it, and the
masks limits the UV light to only hitting

some portions of the chip, and then once thats
done if its negative resist then you have

to bake it one more time, but then you develop
it and then you have a patterned wafer.

So that would have a layer of photo-resist
on top of this with some patterns in it and

then you put it into the HF acid.

The photo-resist will stop the HF acid, but
the HF will still be able to etch through

the (unprotected) SiO2 layers underneath there.

We'll come back to this same drawing here
in the second video when I talk more about

how I do these processes at home.

OK the first topic that I want to go in more
detail about is oxidation, so I talked about

this a bit before, this is the growth of an
oxide layer like SiO2 on the wafer and it

is used for a lot of things, its extremely
useful for passivation so for a protection

layer, its a hydrophilic layer and bare silicon
is hydrophobic so if you want to spin coat

a chemical on to this such as a dopant chemical
you want the silicon to be hydrophilic and

it helps to have a very very thin oxide layer
that you grow onto it and that will allow

the water-based dopant to spin onto it easier,
and its so thin it doesn't act as a dopant

barrier.

When you do a RCA clean steps 1 and 2 it actually
leaves a very thin SiO2 passivation layer

behind, so hydrophilic is very useful however
when you're spinning photo-resist onto it

you want a hydrophobic surface, you want to
get rid of all the water on there, so not

so very good for photo-resist.

Second thing, dopant barrier, so in the previous
drawings I showed you about the MOSFET fabrication

we used the SiO2 layer and then etch a pattern
into it and then that pattern will prevent

the phosphorous atoms from diffusing into
the wafer in those spots, although P atoms

do diffuse through the glass and the glass
will become lightly doped its much slower

than the diffusion through the silicon wafer
so the dopants are effectively blocked by

the SiO2

And then the last 2 uses: Surface dielectric
and device dielectric and this is the use

in MOSFETs because the gate or any device
that makes a capacitor onto a piece of silicon

is using it in this manner where capacitor
is basically 2 parallel plates and this is

the dielectric that separates those 2 plates.

Why SiO2?

Well, it's easy to work with, it can be grown
thermally which is very nice, one of the main

goals of fabrication plants is to cut down
the thermal budget so a lot of times thermal

oxidation is only used in a very very large
high production area when they can keep their

furnaces up 24/7 and keep feeding wafers into
them, at low volume runs the thermal budget

starts to become overwhelming.

Another reason why SiO2 is used is because
its thermal expansion characteristics are

very similar to that of silicon so as you
put the wafer in and out of furnaces in different

steps as the wafer expands and contracts the
SiO2 passivation layers will expand and contract

at a similar rate so that when you pull them
back out of the oven nothing gets cracked

or stretched and all of your CD (Critical
Dimensions) stay very much the same, its not

going to be perfect but its better than other
passivation layers.

Thermal oxidation basically means you take
the wafer and put it in a really hot oven

and the SiO2 will grow onto that naturally
which is very nice.

There's 2 methods: dry and wet.

Wet is much much much faster for a couple
of reasons but to know that you have to understand

the mechanisms first, we'll get there.

This is what's going on for dry oxidation.

We're just using the ambient Oxygen O2 in
the air and then that comes in contact with

the silicon and this should be over a lot
of heat over 1200 degrees C it starts around

900 deg C 1200 deg C is really where you want
to be if you are building an oxide and that

forms SiO2 so -I'll talk about the graph in
a second- so a few different thicknesses here

it can range normally between a 100 and 5000A
is where your practical limits are but this

term here saying that gate oxides are around
150A thats actually not quite true anymore

we are getting at smaller and smaller and
the advantage of thinning out that gate oxide

is giving us a lower threshold voltage on
field effect devices which is great but it

gives us more and more leakage so its kind
of coming to equilibrium here where we do

not want to get the gate oxides much smaller,
and I believe -Im not too sure about this-

but I believe the aspect ratio between gate
length to gate thickness is about 9, I think,

Im not too sure about that, so the thinnest
gates are used for tunneling devices because

you'll experience quantum tunneling at these
very very thin gate oxides and thats part

of the reason why these very thin gate oxides
on MOSFETs they experience leakage because

of the tunneling effect, as we get thicker
than that they are used for pad oxides on

more complicated devices [for LOCOS processing],
passivation is a thick layer, but the thickest

layer of SiO2 that will be used is for field
oxides, its called field oxides not only because

they are dopant barriers, all of these are
for the most part, but because it blocks electric

fields, its too thick to create an electric
field under most conditions, so field oxides

are not used for gate oxides because they
are just too thick, and gate oxides rely on

the fact that the oxide can be used to create
electric fields and store charge in it but

field oxides are too thick and we use that
to our advantage when fabricating devices

because it allows us to insulate multiple
FET devices and grow more metalization layers

and such onto a wafer.

Now let's understand the growth mechanism
real quick, so with any thermal oxidation

for the oxidation to take place, the oxygen
O2 molecules have to come in contact with

the silicon, and at first when you have a
bare silicon wafer and you stick it in the

oven thats great it happens right away you
know you got this oxygen plentiful and you

got the silicon wafer, but then as soon as
you have the first layer of silicon dioxide

grow onto that wafer all the sudden you have
this layer thats blocking the silicon wafer

underneath from the oxygen in the air so the
rate will slow down, because like I said the

reaction can't take place if the oxygen molecules
are not in direct contact with the silicon,

now we have this SiO2 layer in between them,
so for the reaction to continue, either the

silicon atoms have to diffuse up through the
SiO2 to get to the oxygen, or the oxygen has

to diffuse down in the SiO2 to get to the
silicon wafer underneath and thats what happens

with thermal oxidation, so initially this
is called the linear growth stage, and its

defined by linear growth constant B/A times
time t, and that's right here in the graph

here, that happens quite quickly and quite
linearly, but then right here we get into

the parabolic stage and its on the graph basically
an inverse slanted parabola and thats due

to that first SiO2 layer growing so that the
O2 molecules are no longer in direct contact

with the silicon and they have to diffuse
all the way through that SiO2 layer and it

takes a little bit of time to do so, so that's
why we get this parabolic growth area here,

and that can be kind of mitigated when we
get to higher and higher temperatures.

So at 950C this is going to be a more pronounced
parabolic growth and then at 1200C its gonna

be a little bit more linear a little bit better,
but to help that problem even more than just

raising the temperature, we do wet oxidation,
and instead of using ambient O2 atmosphere

we pump steam or water vapor into the furnace,
and this cuts down the time dramatically to

do so.

Initially the linear growth linear is not
changed much, but it will help this parabolic

growth region immensely, and thats because
when we're dealing with dry oxidation we're

waiting for this big O2 molecule to diffuse
through an already formed SiO2 layer, but

with wet oxidation we're starting with Si
+ water and thats gonna yield SiO2 + H2 gas

but since we are dealing with this water vapor
it's actually a hydroxyl ion and it's smaller

and will actually diffuse through SiO2 much
much quicker than this O2 molecule, and that

allows the parabolic growth region to be subdued
and mitigated more, so we have more of a linear

region throughout, and that's why wet oxidation
is really the way to go, especially if you

are doing this at home and you don't want
to wait 24 hours to grow a field oxide, you

can speed things up a lot by doing wet oxidation.

But let's look at the downsides real quick.

A very big goal of semiconductor fabs everywhere
is to decrease the use of steps that involve

liquids.

We want to get everything so that all of these
steps are done with gas sources, because gases

are very pure and easy to maintain pure, so
if we are just feeding this water even if

its high quality deionized distilled water
into the chamber and it becomes water vapor,

there's a lot of opportunities for impurities
to get in there, and the SiO2 film that is

grown will not be as nice and as pure and
as uniform when we do wet oxidation, the nicest

film is with dry oxidation.

Also semiconducting devices generally decrease
in performance as they're exposed to more

and more oxygen throughout all of the thermal
steps, so if we can limit the amount of oxygen

that they are exposed to that's better generally,
it's mainly in diffusion steps where thats

critical.

But the dry oxidation although slower and
more expensive because these furnaces have

to be up higher and for longer, but it does
give you a much nicer oxide, now this is only

an issue when we are talking about things
like gate oxides, that are very small, thin,

precise and can't have a single pinhole on
them.

Because if we have a pinhole on the gate oxide,
its no longer an insulating gate device, your

electric field will be all screwy and the
device characteristics will basically be garbage,

so dry oxidation is a very good method for
making gate oxides.

OK, let's continue talking about oxidation.

So one major thing that influences the rate
of oxidation is the crystal orientation of

the wafer that you are growing it onto.

For example  orientation wafers have
a higher packing density, they have more silicon

atoms per unit volume [? area I think] so
the rate of growth will be a lot faster on

 wafers, and field effect devices are
fabricated on  wafers so that means some

of the thermal steps are slower for making
field effect devices as opposed to MEMS and

bipolar devices.

Oxide layers that are grown over highly doped
phosphorous regions are less dense, this is

very important, they also etch faster thats
because they are grown faster, up to five

times the growth rate which is incredible
so you have to be very careful of this when

you are planning out oxide growth and etching
steps, this also leads to higher undercutting

and lots of other problems, so you think "oh!"
you know "faster rate!" but sometimes thats

an issue.

When we have N type regions an effect called
pile-up happens, and the reverse happens with

P type "depletion", this is because phosphorous,
an N type dopant, has a higher solubility

in silicon than it does in SiO2.

As the SiO2 layer grows, we talked about earlier
how it grows not only above the surface of

the wafer, but also into the wafer itself,
because the oxygen or hydroxyl ions are diffusing

into the wafer surface, so this oxide layer
grows on top of the wafer and into the wafer.

As it grows into the wafer the advancing SiO2
layer, literally pushes the N type dopant

atoms further and further into the wafer,
and they remain at the interface between the

SiO2 and the silicon, so thats pile-up.

And then the reverse happens for P-type dopants,
where they're actually drawn out of the wafer

so both of these you have to be very careful
about when you are designing a process because

they can dramatically affect your dopant distribution.

Another thing that affects rate is the presence
of hydrochloric acid HCl, and there's actually

some methods of oxidation -cooling added oxidation-
that actually uses to increase the rate overall

and this could also introduce a whole lot
of mobile ionic contaminants and other stuff.

Another thing you have to be very careful
about are differential rates, because we talked

about earlier the difference between the linear
and parabolic growth region.

So if you have a wafer, here as an example
these are the steps to make a FET, some regions

of SiO2 are thicker than other regions let's
just say this region here is below 500A, and

this one is about 2000A. this means when we
put this back in the furnace to add more,

this will be in the linear growth stage and
this will be in the parabolic growth region,

this thing will grow faster than that.

So you may think "Oh!

well if I have a growth rate of 1000A per
hour, I put this wafer in the oven and if

I take it out after one hour, everything will
be a 1000A thicker!" that is far from what

will actually happen, you will have a lot
of variations in rates all across your wafer,

because each oxide is in varying stages of
this growth and thats even more expanded on

the non-uniformity of it due to uneven heating
while its in the furnace so theres a lot of

issues there and thats partially where CMP
(chemical mechanical planarization) will come

into play, another extremely complicated topic,
that is outside the scope of this video.

Anyway you have to be careful about differential
oxide growth rates.

Some other processes other than this thermal
oxide growth: I'm not gonna over them, but

it's worth mentioning theres rapid thermal
processes, theres high pressure oxidation

which gets rid of a lot of the issues with
thermal oxidation and then theres anodic oxidation,

which I try theres a video elsewhere on my
youtube channel, the problem is it involves

an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide
or potassium nitrate or something, and thats

very dirty, its hard to control contaminants
in liquid solution, thats why a lot of semiconductor

processes deal only with gases.

So its very simple, basically just passing
a current through - you got your silicon wafer

immersed in this aqueous solution and thats
connected to the positive of a current supply

I use about a 100V DC on mine hence the name
anodic oxidation, and then the negative just

goes to the solution as a whole.

And this is done at room temperature atmospheric
pressure.

This is extremely brief overview of photo-lithography,
people have spent there entire life studying

this one process alone, so I'm not even gonna
scratch the surface with this and I won't

attempt to, but the basic idea of photo-lithography
is patterning a wafer, so in this drawing

here I have a silicon wafer, a SiO2 passivation
layer on top of it, and then a photo-resist

layer thats spun on top of that SiO2 layer.

That photo-resist is a photosensitive paint,
we then have a mask above it that blocks light

in some portions and allows light to go through
in other portions.

Intense DUV deep ultraviolet light is passed
through that masked, and the light is stopped

in this section and the light continues trough
in these sections.

This is a negative acting photo-resist, meaning
that the portions that are exposed to light

become polymerized and then after they are
developed they don't wash away and they become

structures.

So the light is blocked in this little section
in the middle therefore washes away after

being developed and we're left with a hole.

Now photo-lithography is extremely intricate
and there are techniques to expose feature

sizes that are incredibly small in the tens
of nanometers ranges and below and these sizes

are even smaller than the wavelength of the
light used to expose them its absolutely incredible.

You'd expect that the masks used are very
expensive and they are!

The masks are made out of I believe chrome
plates that are written onto directly with

focused electron beam and a set of masks to
make an IC is hundreds and hundreds of thousands

of dollars its absolutely nuts.

There's 2 different [???] of masks, theres
light field and dark field (sometimes called

clear field or light field) and light field
masks, the majority of them is clear its transparent,

and the features you want to transfer are
dark, and thats what this masks up here is,

and then theres dark field masks where the
majority of the mask is dark and the feature

you want to transfer is light and then theres
2 kinds of structure, hole and island, this

is a hole and the inverse of it would be an
island if this portion was polymerized and

these 2 were un-polymerized.

So this is just a quick thing you should be
able to memorize.

Theres a couple different types of photo-resist
theres of course negative and positive, theres

also light-sensitive and energy sensitive
there are resists that are, the majority of

them traditionally are UV sensitive, but theres
also direct e-beam writing and writing and

theres also X-ray methods for doing photo-lithography.

Within the photo-resist theres 4 types of
chemicals: polymer, solvent, sensitizer and

sometimes additives.

The polymer is the actual light-sensitive
part, its the thing that changes structure,

it becomes polymerized or becomes soluble
based on the light that hits it, and the solvent

is I don't know maybe like an alcohol or something
like that, and that allows it to be coated

in very thin layers onto the silicon wafer,
that allows for spin coating basically, and

then theres sensitizers and these are specific
to the brand of photo-resist you buy I guess,

and this allows the company to fine-tune the
actual chemical reaction thats taking place

during exposure, the method of polymerization
basically, and the final thing are additives,

so sometimes they'll add colored dyes into
the photo-resist and other chemicals that

the company desires that increase resolution
capability, process yield, things like that,

maybe its an additive that allows them to
manufacture the photo-resist cheaper, possibly

to make it have longer shelf life, possibly
to focus the sensitized light region, so it

only works on a specific part of the DUV spectrum,
so this kind of thing would be additives inside

the photo-resist.

As far as characteristics of photo-resist,
because you might think that negative and

positive photo-resist are basically interchangeable
but you just have to change your masks, thats

not the case at all, negative and positive
photo-resist are extremely different.

Using positive photo-resist will give you
higher resolution, higher aspect ratio, aspect

ratio is the ratio between the smallest feature
you can make and the thickness of the spin-on

photo-resist.

So positive wins in that category, but negative
is easier to apply, has better adhesion, and

negative also has a faster exposure speed,
so you can run through an automated process

faster and faster so negative is kind of better
in those respects and is easier to work with.

Positive same trend with the resolution, higher
resolution, also higher quality, lower pinhole

and impurity count, positive will flow into
small steps into SiO2 and stuff much easier

and it gives you better coverage in that respect,
but positive is also more expensive, as far

as removing the photo-resist after its been
developed positive can be removed with simple

solvents, some are water soluble, some alcohols
and stuff.

And the negative generally you need chlorinated
substances, more nasty acids and stuff like

that.

The photo-resist strippers for negative are
a little bit more nasty.

Photo-resist is normally spin-coated onto
the wafer, so there'll be a vacuum chuck where

the wafer will be placed onto the chuck and
a vacuum will suck it down onto the platform

so its nice and flat, and then theres either
static or dynamic dispense, where an arm will

come across and dispense the photo-resist
either when it is static when the wafer is

not spinning, or dynamic the wafer will start
spinning and then dispense, and then spin

up to a higher RPM normally in the 3000-5000
RPM range and that will make a nice even coating

of the photo-resist right across the wafer,
and then the excess will fly off and -its

not recycled of course- but it will fly off
and be collected.

Before the photo-resist is spun on, theres
a number of surface treatments that take place

mainly just to get rid of all the water on
this, theres dehydration baking, RCA cleans

and stuff like that are not really used prior
to this because they allow a hydrophilic surface,

but I believe like an HF bath would make sense,
because if theres no previous steps that would

be screwed up by that, an HF bath would leave
a nice hydrophobic surface for the photo-resist

to be applied onto, then it will be spun,
it will be dried, depending on if its negative

or not there might be another soft-bake or
hard-bake step and developed and dried.

Aright lets talk about alignment and exposure
techniques: So the first exposure techniques

were basically contact, and thats where the
mask on top was lowered down so it was touching

the surface of the wafer, UV light was exposed
through, and that was your exposure, and theres

a couple of issues associated with that one
of which is since you actually have a physical

connection between your mask and your wafer,
transfer of contamination, the mask does not

last as long, you can scratch up the surface
of the wafer, things like that, that lent

to the development of proximity exposure systems
where the mask is lifted off the wafer by

a very small gap in between them, so the mask
and wafer are in very close proximity, that

eliminates some of the problems with contact,
but as we get to smaller and smaller feature

sizes, that little gap between the mask and
the surface of the wafer really degrades the

actual resolution that we can get, you know
there's some diffraction, and some of the

light is not passed through that gap as it
should be, some of the light is set there

off at different angles, and the image can
be skewed so your critical dimensions are

not quite what you wanted them to be.

Next we have projection and stepper, stepper
is the most complicated optical setup basically,

and these use reticles or masks and projection
systems so that the light source is further

away from the wafer, its basically similar
to - it's a reverse enlarger if you ever worked

in a dark room developing black and white
photographs, it's the opposite idea of an

enlarger.

So you have a light source and then right
below it you have your mask, and then you

have focusing lenses that focus that down
and then you have your chip that gets exposed,

a piece of silicon and then a stepper can
do very high quality images, the mask contains

the image for one chip, and that gets focused
down onto an entire wafer, and then the wafer

is stepped so that that image for one of the
chips is exposed onto multiple locations on

the wafer, and then the whole wafer is filled
up with that exposed image onto it.

So these ones right here are optical exposure
methods, and then theres energy or non-optical

exposure methods right here, these are done
in vacuum, or at least e-beam is.

so depending on the photoresist, some are
sensitive to x-rays and e-beams, cool thing

you can do with electron beam is that's actually
a direct writing method where no mask is used,

and where you have a very focusable and finely
deflectable electron beam you can use that

to write directly on the photoresist surface,
it's just like a CRT it's like a raster scan

and it wil draw out the image with this e-beam,
I think it has to go over the image a few

times to get it actually burnt into that photo-resist.

OK, let's talk about doping next.

So I'm gonna start with diffusion, which is
a very simple method of doping, it has some

downsides which I'll talk about in a second,
it's commonly done inside a tube surface,

and it's basically you're driving in atoms
of phosphorous, arsenic or boron or whatever

your dopant material is using a lot of heat.

So the steps to do this, these are the steps
to do it with a liquid source, theres liquid

source, gas source and solid source.

Solid source you have to use like BOCl3, gas
source you gonna have diborane and phosphene

gas, and they pump it in a chamber where the
diffusion takes place.

But with liquid source the steps we take to
do that is: first we clean the wafer and if

you etch it with HF after you clean it, you're
going to want to put a very thin layer of

SiO2 onto it so you have a hydrophilic surface
and the next step will go nicely, if you have

a hydrophobic surface caused by the HF then
you won't be able to spin-coat the wafer very

easily, it will bead up and it won't go well,
so I recommend if you have to do an HF step

right before it, do that and then do the first
part of the RCA clean or something like that

to leave a small passivation layer, then the
next step you are going to put a couple of

drops of either a phosphouric acid or boric
acid solution depending on if you are doing

you know N-type or P-type doping, and you're
going to spin-coat that onto your wafer, and

then right after you do that you don't want
to leave it on the wafer too long before you

do the pre-deposition step because you can
get like hazing and things like that because

of the excess oxygen thats going to come into
play here.

The next step known as predeposition places
a high concentration of the heavier phosphorous

or boron atoms and they come out of the acid
and it places them right over the area where

you want to do the diffusion and this can
be done on a hot plate where you just place

your wafer on top of the hotplate on like
a piece of tin foil or something on a couple

of hundred degrees C for 15 minutes or so
or it can be done up to a thousand degrees

C very quickly I'm sure theres also a rapid
thermal process for doing this.

After you do that you'll notice that on top
of the wafer there's a thin, it will be thick

actually, oxide layer that will form because
your phosphorous spin on source is basically

acting as a spin-on glass, and after the predeposition
that will form glass on it, so you can put

that in a weak HF bath maybe 1 or 2 percent,
that will get rid of all the excess phosphorous

film and also that unwanted oxidation on top
of it.

Then you'll do your drive-in step, and this
takes place at 1200deg C optimally, it can

start as low as 950 degrees C but you really
want 1200 degrees C for about 45 minutes,

and you want a very nitrogen rich atmosphere
to do this drive-in diffusion step in.

Once you take it out of the furnace, we talked
earlier about depletion and pile-up, anytime

you put this wafer in a furnace there's going
to be some oxidation, whether you want it

or you don't and that oxidation is going to
change your distribution of dopants, so you

have to be careful about that, so these graphs
they indicate that at the surface here on

an N-type diffused wafer will have a very
high doping concentration as we progress that

will drop of quite steeply because of the
pile-up and then decrease after that.

But then on the surface of a P-type wafer,
it's depleted of those P-type charge carriers

because of the depletion mechanism.

One mostly unwanted side-effect of the diffusion
is lateral diffusion, because ideally if we

wanted to create a N- or P-type well right
here, the atoms would diffuse straight down,

and that would be awesome, but they don't,
they diffuse to the sides, as much as they

diffuse straight down, this is normally unwanted
and this is one of the main reasons for the

ion implantation technology being developed,
which I will talk about in a second.

There are some devices that actually use this
to their advantage, there are LDMOS transistors,

laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor
field effect transistors, and those use lateral

diffusion to I believe they use it in like
high power RF applications, microwave RF applications,

and it allows them to put higher voltages
through the device of this RF energy, they

can put higher voltages before breakdown occurs,
which is interesting.

That pre-deposition step, you better look
at that, once we spin on the film on top of

it right here, then that pre-deposition step
will put a high concentration in this case

of phosphorous atoms right here, and right
here and then they are driven in to create

these N-type wells.

This is the datasheet for emulsitone dopant
this is for Borofilm 100 what they call it,

and it says in here, well this you could basically
assume, at higher temperatures you're going

to have a lower sheet resistance at the end,
and the same with longer times [???] but more

importantly if we look at the atmosphere if
you do this in ambient atmosphere so what's

that you know like 70% nitrogen 20% oxygen
so thats close to right here, thats the sheet

resistance we're gonna have across the wafer,
but if we do it in a purely nitrogen atmosphere,

which it's done close to that commercially
in a fab they'll pump nitrogen through it,

we can decrease the overal sheet resistivity
which is great, so it's very easy to create

an atmosphere inside of a tube furnace, which
is what these steps are normally done in,

you basically just blow the nitrogen into
the furnace, either perpendicularly or parallel

to the wafers themselves, I think in here
it says perpendicularly is best, but depending

on what material you're blowing it, it differs.

So the more nitrogen you have during the diffusion
step, the better electrical characteristics

you can get at the end.

Last thing I want to talk about under doping
is ion implantation, which is a incredibly

complicated and dangerous and expensive and
massive technology which eliminates this lateral

diffusion issue, it also allows for extremely
precise control over the distribution of the

dopants, not onl the depth but also their
concentration at that given depth.

To explain that I'm gonna go to a book that
has some better drawings than I could do,

this is "Microchip fabrication" by Peter Van
Zant, so here is your typical ion implantation

system.

First it's got an ion source, so there'll
be phosphene or diborane gas that will come

in here, it will be ionized into a plasma
state, and then that will be electrostatically

focused into a beam, and there's a mass analyzing
magnet, and these are typically 90 degrees,

somewhere a little bit more than 90 degrees,
and this is set-up so that you can select

which ions you want to implant, the ions that
are heavier than what you want will not be

able to make this sharp turn along the magnet
and will hit the wall, the ions that are heavier

[lighter?] will go too far and smash into
the other side of the wall, and the ions that

are just the right weight of what you want
will make the 90 degree bend and go straight

through, and then they're accelerated electrostatically
and there's some magnetic lenses and such

that give you a nice focusable and deflectable
beam, and these super high energy ion beams

can be in the MeV range and these machines
are massive, then this focused beam can be

scanned across your wafer in a raster scan
style so that it can implant these ions into

the wafer very uniformly.

This is the mass analyzing magnet I was talking
about, so we can select what ions we want

based on their weight.

This is how electrostatic beam deflection
works, we can choose between ions that we

want and other gasses that are not charged
by passing them through electrostatic plates

like this, and we can deflect only the ions
into a wafer that we're implanting and then

the other random gases that are impurities
will continue straight across and be unaffected,

and those can be trapped somewhere else and
extracted.

And this is the beam scanning I was talking
about, so that we can coat the entire wafer

and implant these ions.

Ion implantation can also be used to very
precisely control and modify threshold voltages

of field effect devices like a MOSFET and
can also be used to implant isolation slots,

this is typically used in Gallium Arsenide
high electron mobility field effect transistors

so for microwave applications

OK, the last 2 topics to talk about in this
video.

So everything up to this point has talked
about how to make discrete devices, so how

to make a single transistor, how to make a
diode, something like that, but the difference

between the ability to make discrete devices
and actual integrated circuits is metalization,

metalization allows us to make small connections
between individual transistors that are on

a board and connect them in ways that they
have a greater function than just being individual

transistors, so metalization is done by taking
a wafer that has all these transistors and

everything on it already, and then the entire
wafer surface will be coated with metal, aluminum

or copper something like that, and then same
as photo-lithography process will happen,

and then we can etch away that metal just
to leave little traces and connections that

connect all these individual components on
the board.

There's a few ways of doing that, enter the
big umbrella of deposition, thin film deposition.

There's so many methods that you can research,
mainly there's chemical vapor deposition CVD,

and physical vapor deposition PVD.

So there are lots of CVD techniques, but mainly
they are used to deposit and grow insulators

and semiconductors, out of the insulators
you can do SiO2 and silicon nitride layers,

and out of the semiconductors you can grow
epitaxial silicon, also polysilicon as well.

Evaporation is a PVD technique and it can
be used to deposit conductive metalization

layers, like aluminum, copper, gold, nichrome,
probably like tungsten if you have enough

heat to be able to do that.

Sputtering is another PVD technique, you can
actually sputter SiO2 interestingly enough,

but mainly its used to coat metals, like tungsten,
titanium, molybden, aluminum, a huge use for

sputtering is ITO, Indium Tin Oxide, you can
create clear conductive coatings, and these

are used heavily in organic LED technologies
and thin film displays, things like that.

Molecular beam epitaxy is kind of chemical
process but its considered a PVD technique,

MBE can be used to do so much stuff its incredible,
mainly its used to do complex semiconductors

like GaAs devices, set-up with effusion cells
that have a small super pure sample of whatever

you're trying to deposit wheither its aluminum,
silicon, arsenic, gallium and a very pure

sample of that is heated up with electron
beam, and it basically boils in a vacuum,

that can be deposited onto your substrate
very nicely.

Last topic is etching, so I mentioned earlier
that you can etch SiO2 layers and stuff with

HF acid, but this actually leads to something
called isotropic etching, the HF solution

will etch sideways in unwanted direction as
fast as it etches down in the wanted direction,

so ideally you want anisotropic etching, but
thats not the case with these liquid etching

sources.

So this is why ion beam etching and milling
and plasma etching has come into play, so

you can actually get anisotropic etching.

This is not a problem where you are making
large devices, but as soon as you try to get

things smaller and smaller you have to be
very careful of your critical dimensions,

and you have to allow for this tolerancing,
another thing is every time you put your wafer

in the furnace, your dopants will laterally
diffuse as well, so you have to take into

account unwanted lateral diffusion, and isotropic
etching when you're designing a device.

And you may think "Oh!

I can make a .1 micron device!", well... make
sure you take this into consideration, because

theres a lot of wasted space in chips, especially
older chips before plasma etching and stuff

was very common, there was a lot of space
that was wasted because of isotropic etching

and such.

A way around that to get a more anisotropic
etch, is something like a reactive ion etching

machine, so it consists of a vacuum chamber
and mass flow controller where we can put

a precise amount of reactive gas inside of
it. and then we have this platform down here,

which is sometimes spinning -not very fast
I think- and thats grounded, and then we have

an electrode in the top which ionizes the
reactive gas into a plasma, and thats high

energy RF, normally at 13.56MHz -the specific
reason for using that is just because it's

ISM band, and the harmonics don't screw with
other electronics and stuff- and that RF excites

and ignites the plasma, and it allows you
to do a very controlled etch that's more anisotropic.

This is a reactive ion etching machine, even
more anisotropic than this would be an ion

milling machine, is even more directional
and better.

That's it for this video, I hope you enjoyed
it and learned something, so I'll see you

in the next video that I make which as I said
before will be me explaining how we can do

some of these steps at home, kind of improvising
them and on a pretty low budget as well, and

then the video after that will be an actual
step-by-step demonstration of making transistors

and stuff!
